doc-getting-started-010,Getting Started with NovaCLI v1.0,"NovaCLI v1.0 introduced command-line management for Nova infrastructure. This guide helps new users install and configure NovaCLI to begin managing deployments.

Installation:

Download the appropriate installer for your operating system from the Nova website. Installation packages are available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Linux installation:

wget https://downloads.nova.io/v1.0/novacli-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf novacli-linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv nova /usr/local/bin/

macOS installation:

Download the DMG package and drag NovaCLI to your Applications folder. Create a symlink for command-line access:

ln -s /Applications/http://NovaCLI.app/Contents/MacOS/nova /usr/local/bin/nova

Windows installation:

Run the MSI installer and follow the setup wizard. The installer adds NovaCLI to your PATH automatically.

Initial Configuration:

Create a configuration file:

mkdir ~/.novacli
nova init

This generates a default config.yaml file with placeholder values. Edit the file to add your API credentials:

api_key: your-api-key-here
api_secret: your-api-secret-here
endpoint: https://api.nova.io/v1

Obtain API credentials from the Nova web console under Settings > API Access.

Verify configuration:

nova auth verify

Successful verification displays your account information and confirms API connectivity.

Creating Your First Deployment:

List available regions:

nova regions

Create a deployment:

nova create-deployment --name my-app --region us-east --size small

Note that v1.0 uses different command names than later versions. The create-deployment command was renamed to deploy create in v2.0.

Monitor deployment status:

nova deployment-status my-app

Once the status shows ""running"", retrieve connection details:

nova deployment-info my-app

Deleting a deployment:

nova delete-deployment my-app --confirm

The --confirm flag is required to prevent accidental deletions.

Upgrading:

Consider upgrading to v2.0 or later for improved performance, new features, and ongoing support.

doc-authentication-1.0-temporal_bait,Configuring SCRAM-SHA-256 Authentication,"NovaCLI v1.0 supports SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication for enhanced password security. This guide covers the configuration steps for enabling SCRAM-SHA-256 for read-only database users.

SCRAM-SHA-256 provides stronger authentication than legacy MD5 methods by using challenge-response mechanisms that prevent password transmission over the network. For read-only users accessing reporting databases, proper authentication configuration is essential.

To configure SCRAM-SHA-256 for a read-only user, you must manually edit the PostgreSQL authentication configuration file.

Step 1: Edit pg_hba.conf

Locate the pg_hba.conf file in your PostgreSQL data directory, typically at /var/lib/postgresql/data/pg_hba.conf. Open it with a text editor using sudo privileges.

Add the following line to enable SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication for your read-only user:

host    all    readonly_user    0.0.0.0/0    scram-sha-256

Place this line before any more permissive authentication rules to ensure it takes precedence.

Step 2: Set Password Encryption

Edit postgresql.conf and set the password encryption method:

password_encryption = 'scram-sha-256'

This ensures that new passwords are hashed using SCRAM-SHA-256 instead of MD5.

Step 3: Create the Read-Only User

Connect to PostgreSQL as a superuser and create the read-only user:

CREATE USER readonly_user WITH PASSWORD 'secure_password';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE production TO readonly_user;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO readonly_user;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO readonly_user;

The password will be automatically hashed using SCRAM-SHA-256 based on the password_encryption setting.

Step 4: Reload Configuration

Reload PostgreSQL to apply the pg_hba.conf changes:

pg_ctl reload -D /var/lib/postgresql/data

Alternatively, use the SQL command:

SELECT pg_reload_conf();

Step 5: Verify Authentication

Test the connection using the read-only user credentials:

psql -h http://localhost -U readonly_user -d production

doc-logging-1.0-temporal_bait,Configuring Application Logging in NovaCLI,"NovaCLI v1.0 provides flexible logging capabilities to help monitor application behavior and troubleshoot issues. This guide covers how to configure logging output, formats, and verbosity levels.

Logging configuration is managed through the config.yaml file in the logging section. Default settings provide basic informational logging to standard output, but production deployments typically require customized logging configurations.

Basic Logging Configuration:

logging:
  level: info
  output: stdout
  format: text

The level setting controls logging verbosity. Available levels in order of increasing detail: error, warn, info, debug. Set to debug for detailed troubleshooting, but be aware this generates significant log volume in production.

Output Destinations:

Logs can be directed to multiple destinations. For file-based logging:

logging:
  output: /var/log/novacli/application.log

For syslog integration:

logging:
  output: syslog://http://localhost:514

Use stdout for containerized deployments where log aggregation systems capture container output streams.

Log Formats:

NovaCLI v1.0 supports two output formats. The text format provides human-readable output suitable for interactive debugging:

2022-03-15 14:23:10 INFO Deployment started id=dep-123 user=admin

The structured format outputs key-value pairs for easier parsing by log analysis tools:

time=2022-03-15T14:23:10Z level=INFO msg=""Deployment started"" deployment_id=dep-123 user=admin

Set the format in configuration:

logging:
  format: structured

Log Rotation:

For file-based logging, configure automatic rotation to prevent disk exhaustion:

logging:
  output: /var/log/novacli/application.log
  rotate:
    max_size_mb: 100
    max_files: 5
    compress: true

Logs are rotated when they reach max_size_mb. The system retains max_files historical log files and compresses older files to save disk space.

Dynamic Log Level Changes:

Change log verbosity at runtime without restarting:

nova config set logging.level debug

This immediately affects new log entries without disrupting running operations.

doc-env_vars-1.0-temporal_bait,Using Environment Variables in NovaCLI,"NovaCLI v1.0 supports environment variable configuration as an alternative to editing configuration files. This guide explains how to use environment variables to customize application behavior across different deployment environments.

Environment variables provide a convenient way to override default settings without modifying config.yaml files. This is particularly useful in containerized deployments and continuous integration pipelines where configuration files may not be easily accessible.

NovaCLI recognizes environment variables with the NOVACLI_ prefix. Variable names follow the pattern NOVACLI_SECTION_KEY, corresponding to sections and keys in the YAML configuration file.

Configuration file:

server:
  host: http://api.nova.io
  port: 443

Equivalent environment variables:

NOVACLI_SERVER_HOST=http://api.nova.io
NOVACLI_SERVER_PORT=443

For nested configuration sections, use single underscores to separate levels:

logging:
  output:
    file: /var/log/nova.log

Environment variable:

NOVACLI_LOGGING_OUTPUT_FILE=/var/log/nova.log

Environment variables take precedence over configuration file values, allowing you to maintain a base configuration file and override specific settings per environment.

Common environment variables:

NOVACLI_SERVER_HOST: API endpoint URL
NOVACLI_SERVER_PORT: API port number
NOVACLI_AUTH_TOKEN: Authentication token
NOVACLI_LOGGING_LEVEL: Log verbosity (error, warn, info, debug)
NOVACLI_LOGGING_OUTPUT: Log destination

Boolean values accept 1/0 or true/false. String values with spaces should be quoted in shell environments:

export NOVACLI_SERVER_HOST=""http://api.production.nova.io""

To view all active environment variables affecting NovaCLI:

env | grep NOVACLI_

This displays all NOVACLI_ prefixed variables currently set in your shell environment.

For security-sensitive values like authentication tokens, environment variables are preferable to storing credentials in configuration files. Always avoid committing credentials to version control.

When troubleshooting configuration issues, remember that environment variables override file settings.

doc-changelog-005,Release Notes: NovaCLI v2.0.0,"NovaCLI v2.0.0 is a major release introducing a redesigned authentication system, YAML configuration support, and significant performance improvements. This release requires migration from v1.x.

Breaking Changes:

New Authentication System:

Password-based authentication is replaced with token-based authentication:

nova auth login

Tokens are securely stored in system keychain. Old password authentication is deprecated and will be removed in v3.0.

YAML Configuration:

Configuration files now use YAML format for improved readability:

Location: ~/.nova/config.yaml

v1.x INI files are automatically migrated on first run.

Command Changes:

- nova create → nova deploy create
- nova delete → nova deploy delete
- nova list → nova deploy list
- nova show → nova deploy get

Old commands are removed. Use migration aliases for transition period.

New Features:

Deployment Templates:

Save deployment configurations as reusable templates:

nova template create --name ""production-db"" --size large --region us-east --backups enabled

Create deployments from templates:

nova deploy create --template production-db --name customer-db

Automated Backups:

Schedule automatic backups with customizable frequency:

nova backup schedule deployment-id --frequency daily --time ""03:00"" --retention 30

Resource Metrics:

Detailed metrics for capacity planning:

nova deploy metrics deployment-id --metric cpu --duration 30d

Metrics include CPU, memory, storage, IOPS, and network throughput.

Performance Improvements:

- Deployment provisioning speed increased 2x
- API response time reduced by 60%
- Backup operations 40% faster
- Reduced memory footprint for CLI

Upgrade Instructions:

v1.x users must upgrade CLI before upgrading deployments:

1. Install v2.0 CLI
2. Run: nova config migrate --from v1
3. Re-authenticate: nova auth login
4. Upgrade deployments: nova deploy upgrade deployment-id --version 2.0

Migration guide: https://docs.nova.io/migration/v1-to-v2

Support Timeline:

doc-getting-started-015,First Steps with NovaCLI v2.0,"NovaCLI v2.0 provides command-line tools for managing your Nova infrastructure. This guide walks through installation, authentication, and creating your first deployment.

Installation was covered in the installation guide for your operating system. Verify NovaCLI is installed:

nova --version

You should see version 2.0.x displayed.

Authentication:

NovaCLI v2.0 uses API key authentication. Obtain your API key from the Nova web console:

1. Log into http://console.nova.io
2. Navigate to Settings > API Keys
3. Click ""Generate New Key""
4. Copy the key immediately; it won't be shown again

Configure NovaCLI with your API key:

nova config set api_key <your-api-key>

Verify authentication:

nova auth verify

Successful verification displays your account email and organization name.

Exploring Available Resources:

List regions where you can deploy:

nova regions

View instance sizes and pricing:

nova sizes

Creating Your First Deployment:

Use the create-deployment command (renamed to deploy create in v3.0):

nova create-deployment 
  --name my-first-app 
  --region us-east 
  --size small 
  --engine postgres-13

Note that v2.0 uses ""us-east"" rather than ""us-east-1"". Region naming changed in v3.0 to align with AWS conventions.

NovaCLI displays a deployment ID. Save this for managing the deployment.

Monitor deployment status:

nova deployment-status my-first-app

You can use either the deployment name or ID. Status shows: pending, creating, running, error.

Once status reaches ""running"", get connection details:

nova deployment-info my-first-app

This shows the hostname, port, username, and password. Use these to connect with a database client.

Managing Deployments:

List all your deployments:

nova list-deployments

Stop a deployment temporarily:

nova stop-deployment my-first-app

Stopped deployments don't incur compute charges but storage charges continue.

Restart a stopped deployment:

nova start-deployment my-first-app

Delete a deployment permanently:

nova delete-deployment my-first-app --confirm

The --confirm flag prevents accidental deletions.

doc-migration-006,Migrating Authentication from v1.x to v2.x,"NovaCLI v2.0 replaced password-based authentication with token-based authentication. This guide walks through the authentication migration process for v1.x users.

Authentication Changes Overview:

v1.x Authentication:
- Username and password stored locally
- Password sent with each API request
- No token expiration
- Manual password rotation required

v2.x Authentication:
- Token-based authentication
- Tokens stored in system keychain
- 90-day inactivity expiration
- Automatic token refresh
- Support for multiple accounts

Migration Process:

Step 1: Upgrade CLI to v2.0:

curl -sSL https://install.nova.io/v2 | bash
nova --version
# Should show v2.0.x

Step 2: Authenticate with new system:

nova auth login

You'll be prompted for username and password. After successful login, a token is generated and stored securely.

Step 3: Verify authentication:

nova auth status

Should display:
- Authenticated as: your-username
- Token expires: date
- Account: your-account-name

Step 4: Remove old credentials:

v1.x stored credentials in ~/.nova/credentials. Remove this file:

rm ~/.nova/credentials

Token Storage:

Tokens are stored in system keychain:
- macOS: Keychain Access
- Windows: Credential Manager
- Linux: Secret Service (GNOME Keyring, KWallet)

Manual token access (if needed):

nova auth get-token

Copies token to clipboard for use in scripts or external tools.

Multiple Accounts:

v2.x supports multiple account configurations:

Add second account:
nova auth login --account staging

Switch between accounts:
nova auth switch production
nova auth switch staging

List all accounts:
nova auth list

Token Management:

Create service tokens for automation:

nova auth create-token --name ""CI Pipeline"" --scope ""read:deployments,write:deployments""

List all tokens:
nova auth list-tokens

Revoke tokens:
nova auth revoke-token token-id

Security Improvements:

v2.x provides enhanced security:
- Tokens are encrypted at rest
- Automatic token rotation
- Granular permission scopes
- Audit logging for token usage
- Token expiration and renewal

Troubleshooting Migration:

Issue: Login fails with old credentials
Solution: Password may need reset. Use nova auth reset-password

Issue: Keychain access denied
Solution: Grant keychain access in system settings

Issue: Token expires immediately
Solution: Check system time synchronization

Backward Compatibility:

doc-getting-started-005,System Requirements,"NovaCLI v2.0 has minimal system requirements, making it accessible across a wide range of hardware configurations. This document outlines the requirements for each supported platform.

Operating Systems:

Linux: Any distribution with kernel 3.10 or newer. Officially tested on Ubuntu 18.04+, Debian 10+, CentOS 7+, Fedora 32+, and Arch Linux. Both x86_64 and ARM64 architectures are supported.

macOS: Version 10.14 Mojave or later. Supports Intel x86_64 and Apple Silicon ARM64 processors. Rosetta 2 is not required for Apple Silicon Macs as native binaries are provided.

Windows: Windows 10 version 1809 or later, Windows 11, and Windows Server 2019+. Requires 64-bit architecture. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is optional but not required.

Hardware Requirements:

CPU: Single core minimum, dual core recommended for optimal performance. No specific processor requirements beyond architecture support.

RAM: 256 MB minimum, 512 MB recommended. Memory usage scales with deployment size and concurrent operations.

Disk Space: 50 MB for the NovaCLI binary and dependencies. Additional space required for logs and cached configuration data, typically under 100 MB.

Network: Internet connection required for API access to Nova services. Minimum bandwidth of 1 Mbps recommended. Supports HTTP proxies and corporate firewalls.

Software Dependencies:

No external dependencies for basic operation. Optional dependencies include:
- OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later for enhanced TLS support
- Git for version control integration features
- Docker for local testing and validation
- Curl for scripting and automation

Cloud and Container Environments:

doc-config_format-2.0-temporal_bait,YAML Configuration Guide for NovaCLI,"NovaCLI v2.0 uses YAML as its configuration format, providing a clean and human-readable syntax for managing application settings. This guide covers the structure and best practices for creating NovaCLI configuration files.

YAML was chosen for its simplicity and widespread adoption across DevOps tools. The configuration file is located at ~/.novacli/config.yaml by default, though you can specify an alternative path using the --config flag.

Basic configuration structure:

server:
  host: http://api.nova.io
  port: 443
  timeout: 30

auth:
  method: token
  token_file: ~/.novacli/token

logging:
  level: info
  output: /var/log/nova.log

YAML uses indentation to denote hierarchy. Always use spaces, never tabs. Each indentation level should be exactly 2 spaces. Inconsistent indentation will cause parsing errors.

String values typically do not require quotes unless they contain special characters like colons, brackets, or begin with reserved characters. When in doubt, use double quotes.

Arrays can be written in two formats. Flow style uses brackets:

allowed_ips: [192.168.1.0/24, 10.0.0.0/8]

Block style uses dashes:

allowed_ips:
  - 192.168.1.0/24
  - 10.0.0.0/8

Boolean values use true/false or yes/no. Avoid using on/off as they can be ambiguous in some YAML parsers.

Comments begin with the # character and continue to the end of the line. Use comments generously to document non-obvious configuration choices.

Environment-specific configurations can be managed using YAML anchors and aliases. Define common settings once and reference them:

defaults: &defaults
  timeout: 30
  retry: 3

production:
  <<: defaults
  host: http://prod.nova.io

development:
  <<: defaults
  host: http://dev.nova.io

To validate your configuration file syntax, use:

nova config validate

This checks for YAML syntax errors, missing required fields, and invalid values before attempting to use the configuration in production.

For sensitive values like API tokens, consider using environment variable substitution:

auth:
  token: ${NOVA_API_TOKEN}

doc-configuration-018,Database Connection Pooling,"NovaCLI v2.0 deployments use connection pooling to optimize database performance. This guide covers pool configuration, sizing, and monitoring.

Basic Pool Configuration:

Configure connection pool settings:

[database.pool]
min_connections = 5
max_connections = 50
max_idle_time = 300  # seconds
max_lifetime = 3600  # seconds

Minimum maintains ready connections. Maximum prevents resource exhaustion.

Connection Timeout:

Control connection acquisition:

[database.pool.timeout]
connection_timeout = 10  # seconds
validation_timeout = 5

Application blocks until connection available or timeout.

Connection Validation:

Verify connection health:

[database.pool.validation]
test_on_borrow = true
test_on_return = false
test_while_idle = true
validation_query = ""SELECT 1""
validation_interval = 30

Prevents using stale connections.

Pool Sizing Guidelines:

Recommended pool sizes by workload:

Low traffic (<100 req/sec):
- min: 5
- max: 20

Medium traffic (100-500 req/sec):
- min: 10
- max: 50

High traffic (>500 req/sec):
- min: 20
- max: 100

Formula: max_connections = (core_count * 2) + effective_spindle_count

For SSDs, effective_spindle_count = 1.

Connection Leaks:

Detect and handle leaks:

[database.pool.leak_detection]
enabled = true
threshold = 60000  # milliseconds
log_stack_trace = true

Logs warning if connection held longer than threshold.

Pool Monitoring:

Expose pool metrics:

[database.pool.metrics]
enabled = true
active_connections = true
idle_connections = true
waiting_threads = true
connection_create_time = true
connection_usage_time = true

Metrics help identify bottlenecks.

Multiple Pools:

Separate pools for different purposes:

[database.pools.primary]
url = ""postgres://primary-db:5432/main""
max_connections = 50

[database.pools.readonly]
url = ""postgres://replica-db:5432/main""
max_connections = 30
read_only = true

[http://database.pools.analytics]
url = ""postgres://analytics-db:5432/warehouse""
max_connections = 10

Route queries to appropriate pool.

Connection Initialization:

Execute SQL on new connections:

[database.pool.initialization]
init_sql = ""SET application_name = 'novacli'; SET statement_timeout = 30000;""

Sets connection-level parameters.

Failover Configuration:

Handle database failover:

[database.pool.failover]
enabled = true
retry_attempts = 3
retry_delay = 1000  # milliseconds

Retries failed connections before reporting error.

Pool Preloading:

Warm up pool at startup:

[database.pool.preload]
enabled = true
connections_to_create = 10

Reduces latency for initial requests.

Statement Caching:

Cache prepared statements:

[database.pool.statement_cache]
enabled = true
max_statements = 250
max_statements_per_connection = 50

Improves performance for repeated queries.

Dynamic Pool Sizing:

Adjust pool based on load:

[database.pool.dynamic]
enabled = true
scale_up_threshold = 0.8
scale_down_threshold = 0.3
scale_increment = 5

Automatically grows/shrinks within configured limits.

Connection Draining:

Graceful shutdown:

[database.pool.shutdown]
drain_timeout = 30  # seconds
force_close_after = 60

Waits for active connections to complete.

Troubleshooting:

Common pool issues:

- Exhausted pool: Increase max_connections or reduce connection hold time
- Slow connection creation: Check network latency to database

doc-troubleshooting-017,Fixing CLI Installation Problems,"NovaCLI installation issues prevent users from accessing any functionality. Understanding platform-specific installation requirements and common failures enables quick resolution.

Permission Denied Errors:

Installation to system directories requires elevated privileges:

Linux/macOS: sudo ./http://install.sh
Windows: Run installer as Administrator

For user-level installation without admin rights:

./http://install.sh --user

This installs to ~/.local/bin (Linux/macOS) or %LOCALAPPDATA% (Windows).

Path Configuration:

After installation, NovaCLI may not be in PATH. Add manually:

Linux/macOS bash: echo 'export PATH=""$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH""' >> ~/.bashrc
macOS zsh: echo 'export PATH=""$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH""' >> ~/.zshrc
Windows: Add %LOCALAPPDATA%ProgramsNovaCLI to system PATH

Restart your shell after PATH changes.

Dependency Issues:

NovaCLI requires certain system libraries. On Linux, install dependencies:

Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libffi-dev
CentOS/RHEL: sudo yum install openssl-devel libffi-devel

Python Version:

NovaCLI v2.0 requires Python 3.7 or newer. Check version:

python3 --version

Upgrade Python if needed:

Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install python3.9
macOS: brew install python@3.9

Checksum Verification Failed:

Corrupted downloads fail checksum verification. Re-download the installer:

curl -O https://downloads.nova.io/novacli-latest.tar.gz

Verify checksum manually:

sha256sum novacli-latest.tar.gz

Compare output to published checksums at https://downloads.nova.io/checksums.txt

Conflicting Installations:

Multiple NovaCLI versions conflict. Remove old installations:

Linux/macOS: sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/nova ~/.nova
Windows: Uninstall via Control Panel

Reinstall after cleanup.

Architecture Mismatch:

Ensure installer matches your CPU architecture:

x86_64 (Intel/AMD): novacli-x86_64.tar.gz
ARM64 (Apple Silicon, ARM servers): novacli-arm64.tar.gz

Offline Installation:

For systems without internet access, download dependencies separately:

pip download novacli

doc-configuration-009,YAML Configuration Migration Guide,"NovaCLI v2.0 used YAML configuration files. Version 3.0 transitioned to TOML for improved clarity and tooling support. This guide helps migrate existing YAML configurations to TOML format.

Key Differences:

TOML uses explicit sections and typed values:

YAML:
database:
  max_connections: 100
  timeout: 30

TOML:
[database]
max_connections = 100
timeout = 30

Array syntax differs:

YAML:
allowed_ips:
  - 192.168.1.1
  - 10.0.0.0/8

TOML:
allowed_ips = [""192.168.1.1"", ""10.0.0.0/8""]

Automatic Migration:

Convert YAML to TOML automatically:

nova config migrate config.yaml --output config.toml

Validates syntax and preserves comments where possible.

Manual Migration Steps:

1. Convert top-level keys to TOML sections
2. Change colon syntax to equals
3. Quote all string values
4. Convert arrays to bracket notation
5. Remove YAML-specific features (anchors, aliases)

Common Migration Issues:

Null values:
YAML allows null; TOML requires omitting the key or using empty string.

YAML:
optional_value: null

TOML:
# optional_value omitted entirely
# or
optional_value = """"

Multiline strings:
YAML uses pipes or angle brackets; TOML uses triple quotes.

YAML:
description: |
  This is a
  multiline string

TOML:
description = """"""
This is a
multiline string
""""""

Boolean values:
YAML accepts yes/no; TOML requires true/false.

YAML:
enabled: yes

TOML:
enabled = true

Configuration Validation:

Validate migrated configuration:

nova config validate config.toml

Reports syntax errors and missing required fields.

Gradual Migration:

NovaCLI v3.0 supports both formats during transition period:

nova settings load config.yaml  # Still works in v3.0

However, YAML support is deprecated and will be removed in v4.0.

Version Control Considerations:

Commit both YAML and TOML during transition:

git add config.yaml config.toml
git commit -m ""Add TOML configuration (migrating from YAML)""

Update deployment scripts incrementally:

# Old
nova settings load config.yaml

# New
nova settings load config.toml

Testing Migration:

Compare behavior before and after migration:

nova deploy create --config config.yaml --dry-run > before.txt
nova deploy create --config config.toml --dry-run > after.txt
diff before.txt after.txt

Ensures migrated configuration produces identical deployments.

Rollback Plan:

Keep YAML configuration until migration is fully validated. If issues arise:

nova settings load config.yaml

doc-troubleshooting-004,Fixing Deployment Creation Failures,"Deployment creation can fail for several reasons in NovaCLI v2.0, ranging from quota limits to configuration errors. Understanding error messages helps resolve these issues quickly and successfully provision deployments.

Quota Exceeded Errors:

The most common failure is exceeding your account quota. Error message: ""Deployment creation failed: Account quota exceeded (current: 5/5 deployments)."" Upgrade your plan or delete unused deployments:

nova deploy list --status stopped
nova deploy delete deployment-id

Invalid Configuration:

Deployment creation requires valid configuration parameters. Common mistakes include:

- Invalid region names (use nova regions list to see available regions)
- Unsupported deployment sizes (use nova sizes list for valid options)
- Invalid version numbers

Verify your configuration before creating:

nova deploy validate --config deployment.toml

Network Configuration Errors:

VPC and subnet configuration errors cause creation failures. Ensure your VPC has available IP addresses and correct routing configuration. The error ""No available IP addresses in subnet"" indicates subnet exhaustion. Create a larger subnet or use a different VPC.

Insufficient Permissions:

If you see ""Permission denied: cannot create deployment in this region,"" your account lacks regional deployment permissions. Contact your administrator to grant appropriate permissions or switch to an allowed region.

Resource Availability:

Occasionally, deployments fail due to temporary resource unavailability: ""Deployment creation failed: Insufficient capacity in region us-east."" Retry in a different availability zone:

nova deploy create --region us-east --zone us-east-2

Or choose an alternative region.

Configuration File Errors:

YAML syntax errors in v2.0 configuration files cause parsing failures. Validate YAML syntax:

nova config validate deployment.yaml

Common YAML issues include incorrect indentation, missing colons, and unquoted special characters.

Timeout Issues:

Deployment creation typically completes within 5-10 minutes. If creation exceeds 15 minutes, the operation may have stalled. Check deployment status:

doc-configuration-028,Schema Migration Configuration,"NovaCLI v2.0 provides tools for managing database schema migrations across deployment versions. This guide covers migration strategy, versioning, and rollback procedures.

Migration Strategy:

Configure migration approach:

[migrations]
strategy = ""forward_only""  # or ""reversible"", ""snapshot""
auto_migrate = false  # Manual approval
validation_enabled = true

Forward-only: Only upgrade migrations
Reversible: Support up and down migrations
Snapshot: Complete schema replacement

Migration Files:

Migration file structure:

migrations/
  001_initial_schema.sql
  002_add_users_table.sql
  003_add_indexes.sql
  004_alter_constraints.sql

File naming:
- Sequential numbering
- Descriptive name
- .sql extension

Create migration:

nova migrate create 
  --name add_audit_columns 
  --output migrations/

Generates template with up/down sections.

Migration Execution:

Run pending migrations:

nova migrate up <deployment-id>

Dry run first:

nova migrate up <deployment-id> --dry-run

Shows SQL without executing.

Migration Status:

Check migration status:

nova migrate status <deployment-id>

Displays:
- Applied migrations
- Pending migrations
- Failed migrations

Rollback:

Rollback last migration:

nova migrate down <deployment-id>

Rollback to specific version:

nova migrate rollback <deployment-id> 
  --to-version 5

Migration Locking:

Prevent concurrent migrations:

[migrations.locking]
enabled = true
lock_timeout = 300  # seconds
auto_release = true

Transaction Management:

Configure transaction behavior:

[migrations.transactions]
per_migration = true  # Each migration in own transaction
allow_ddl = true
statement_timeout = 600  # seconds

Backup Before Migration:

Automatic pre-migration backup:

[migrations.backup]
auto_backup = true
backup_before_migrate = true
retention_days = 7

Restore from backup:

nova migrate restore <deployment-id> 
  --backup-id <backup-id>

Validation:

Validate migrations:

nova migrate validate migrations/

Checks:
- SQL syntax
- Naming conventions
- Reversibility
- Dependencies

Zero-Downtime Migrations:

Perform migrations without downtime:

[http://migrations.zero_downtime]
enabled = true
strategy = ""expand_contract""
verify_compatibility = true

Expand-contract pattern:
1. Expand: Add new schema
2. Deploy: Update application
3. Contract: Remove old schema

Data Migrations:

Migrate data separately:

[http://migrations.data]
separate_from_schema = true
batch_size = 1000
progress_reporting = true

Run data migration:

nova migrate data <deployment-id> 
  --migration 005_migrate_user_data

Dependency Management:

Manage migration dependencies:

# 006_add_foreign_key.sql
-- depends: 004_add_users_table
-- depends: 005_add_orders_table

ALTER TABLE orders ADD CONSTRAINT fk_user...

Migration Testing:

Test migrations in staging:

nova migrate test 
  --deployment staging-deployment 
  --migrations migrations/

Runs migrations, validates, then rolls back.

Migration History:

View migration history:

nova migrate history <deployment-id>

Shows:
- Applied date
- Applied by
- Duration
- Status

Schema Versioning:

Track schema versions:

[migrations.versioning]
version_table = ""schema_migrations""
track_checksums = true

Compare schemas:

nova migrate diff

doc-troubleshooting-013,Handling Disk Space Exhaustion,"Disk space exhaustion causes deployment failures, data loss, and service interruptions. Proactive monitoring and space management prevent these issues in NovaCLI v2.0 deployments.

Detecting Space Exhaustion:

Monitor disk usage regularly:

nova deploy stats deployment-id --metric disk

When usage exceeds 85%, take corrective action before reaching 100%.

Immediate Response:

When disk is full, deployments enter read-only mode to prevent corruption. Error messages include:

- ""Disk space exhausted: deployment is read-only""
- ""Cannot write: no space left on device""
- ""Database is full""

Delete unnecessary data or resize storage immediately:

nova deploy resize deployment-id --storage 500

Storage resize typically completes within 5-10 minutes without downtime.

Identifying Space Consumers:

Find which components consume the most space:

nova deploy disk-usage deployment-id --breakdown

This shows space used by data files, indexes, logs, backups, and temporary files.

Cleaning Temporary Files:

Temporary files accumulate during normal operations. Clean them safely:

nova deploy clean deployment-id --type temp

This removes temporary files created by queries, imports, and maintenance operations.

Log File Management:

Logs can consume significant space. Rotate or truncate old logs:

nova deploy logs rotate deployment-id

Configure log retention to prevent unbounded growth:

nova deploy update deployment-id --log-retention-days 7

Index Maintenance:

Unused or redundant indexes waste space. List all indexes:

nova deploy indexes deployment-id --unused

Drop indexes that are never used:

nova deploy drop-index deployment-id index-name

Vacuum and Compact:

Deleted data may not be immediately reclaimed. Run vacuum to recover space:

nova deploy vacuum deployment-id

For significant space recovery, use full vacuum:

nova deploy vacuum deployment-id --full

Full vacuum requires exclusive locks and may take significant time on large deployments.

Archiving Old Data:

Move historical data to cheaper storage:

nova deploy archive deployment-id --table logs --older-than 90d

This archives data older than 90 days to cold storage, freeing primary disk space.

Monitoring and Alerts:

doc-troubleshooting-009,Resolving Version Upgrade Failures,"Upgrading NovaCLI deployments to newer versions occasionally fails due to compatibility issues, resource constraints, or data migration problems. Understanding upgrade prerequisites and rollback procedures minimizes disruption.

Pre-Upgrade Checklist:

Before upgrading, verify compatibility and prerequisites:

1. Check release notes for breaking changes
2. Verify sufficient disk space (upgrades require 20% free space)
3. Create a manual backup before upgrading
4. Review deprecated features in current version
5. Test upgrade in a staging environment if available

Common Upgrade Failures:

Upgrade failures typically manifest as:

- ""Incompatible version: cannot upgrade from v1.0 to v3.1""
- ""Insufficient disk space for migration""
- ""Data migration failed: schema mismatch""
- ""Upgrade timeout: operation exceeded 60 minutes""

Version Compatibility:

NovaCLI requires sequential major version upgrades. You cannot skip major versions. To upgrade from v1.0 to v3.1:

nova deploy upgrade deployment-id --version 2.0
[wait for completion]
nova deploy upgrade deployment-id --version 3.0
[wait for completion]
nova deploy upgrade deployment-id --version 3.1

Disk Space Requirements:

Data migration creates temporary tables and indexes, requiring additional disk space. If upgrade fails with ""Insufficient disk space,"" resize storage before retrying:

nova deploy resize deployment-id --storage 200

After successful upgrade, you can reduce storage if excess capacity is no longer needed.

Migration Timeout:

Large databases may exceed the default 60-minute upgrade timeout. Increase timeout for large deployments:

nova deploy upgrade deployment-id --version 3.1 --timeout 180

This allows 3 hours for migration to complete.

Rollback Procedure:

If upgrade fails or causes issues, rollback to the previous version:

nova deploy rollback deployment-id

Rollback restores the pre-upgrade snapshot. Data created after upgrade begins is lost, so test thoroughly in staging before production upgrades.

Partial Upgrade Failures:

doc-troubleshooting-023,Debugging Unexpected Query Results,"Query results that don't match expectations indicate data issues, query logic errors, or caching problems. Systematic debugging identifies the root cause in NovaCLI v2.0.

Verifying Data Integrity:

First, confirm the underlying data is correct:

nova deploy query deployment-id --query ""SELECT COUNT() FROM table""

Compare counts to expected values. Unexpected counts indicate data issues.

Query Logic Review:

Common query logic errors:

- Incorrect JOIN conditions causing cartesian products
- WHERE clauses with wrong operators (= instead of IN)
- Missing GROUP BY causing aggregation errors
- Incorrect date comparisons (timezone issues)

Simplify queries to isolate problems:

Start with basic SELECT without joins or filters, then add complexity incrementally.

Caching Issues:

Query result caching may return stale data. Bypass cache:

nova deploy query deployment-id --query ""SELECT  FROM table"" --no-cache

If results differ, clear query cache:

nova deploy clear-cache deployment-id --type query

Transaction Isolation:

Isolation levels affect query visibility of uncommitted changes. Check isolation level:

nova deploy get deployment-id --format json | jq '.isolation_level'

For stricter consistency, increase isolation:

nova deploy update deployment-id --isolation-level serializable

Replication Lag:

Read replicas may serve stale data due to replication lag. Query primary directly:

nova deploy query deployment-id --target primary --query ""SELECT  FROM table""

Compare results from primary and replica to identify lag-related discrepancies.

Timezone Confusion:

Timezone handling causes unexpected date filtering results. Always use explicit timezone-aware timestamps:

SELECT  FROM logs WHERE created_at > '2024-09-01T00:00:00Z'

Floating-point Precision:

Floating-point arithmetic may produce unexpected results. Use DECIMAL for exact arithmetic:

ALTER TABLE prices MODIFY COLUMN price DECIMAL(10,2);

Data Type Coercion:

Implicit type conversion causes unexpected comparisons:

SELECT  FROM users WHERE id = '123'  -- String '123' coerced to integer

Use explicit casting:

SELECT  FROM users WHERE id = CAST('123' AS INTEGER)

Index Usage:

Missing indexes may cause incomplete results if queries timeout. Check query execution plan:

doc-configuration-005,Multi-Environment Configuration Strategies,"Managing configurations across development, staging, and production environments requires careful strategy. This guide demonstrates patterns for maintaining environment-specific settings while minimizing duplication.

Configuration Hierarchy:

Structure configuration with base settings and environment overrides:

config/
  base.toml          # Shared settings
  development.toml   # Dev overrides
  staging.toml       # Staging overrides
  production.toml    # Production overrides

Base configuration contains common settings:

# base.toml
[database]
max_connections = 100

[logging]
format = ""json""

Environment files override specific values:

# development.toml
[database]
max_connections = 20  # Fewer connections in dev

[logging]
level = ""debug""       # Verbose logging

# production.toml
[logging]
level = ""info""        # Less verbose

[security]
ssl_required = true

Load configuration with environment flag:

nova settings load --base base.toml --env development.toml

Environment Variables:

Use environment variables for sensitive values:

# production.toml
[database]
password = ""${DATABASE_PASSWORD}""

[api]
api_key = ""${API_KEY}""

Never commit secrets to version control. Inject via environment at runtime.

Profile-Based Management:

Use NovaCLI profiles for environment switching:

nova profiles create development
nova profiles create staging  
nova profiles create production

Each profile stores distinct credentials and default settings:

nova settings set --profile production default.region us-east-1
nova settings set --profile development default.size small

Switch environments:

nova profiles use production
nova deploy list  # Shows production deployments

Validation Rules:

Enforce environment-specific validation:

# development.toml
[validation]
ssl_required = false
allow_public_access = true

# production.toml
[validation]
ssl_required = true
allow_public_access = false
backup_enabled = true

Prevents deploying dev-appropriate configs to production.

Automation Integration:

CI/CD pipelines select environments:

# GitHub Actions
- name: Deploy to Staging
  run: |
    nova --profile staging deploy create 
      --config config/staging.toml

Infrastructure as Code:

Version control all configurations:

git add config/*.toml
git commit -m ""Update production database settings""

Peer review configuration changes like code changes.

Configuration Drift Detection:

Compare deployed configuration against source:

doc-changelog-004,Release Notes: NovaCLI v2.3.0,"NovaCLI v2.3.0 introduces deployment health monitoring, improved backup management, and enhanced networking capabilities. This release improves operational visibility and reliability.

New Features:

Health Check Endpoints:

Deployments now expose standardized health check endpoints for integration with monitoring systems:

nova deploy health deployment-id --expose-endpoint

Health endpoints report:
- Overall health status (healthy, degraded, unhealthy)
- Component-level status (storage, network, replication)
- Recent error counts
- Performance metrics

Backup Retention Policies:

Configurable retention policies automatically manage backup lifecycle:

nova backup set-retention deployment-id --daily 7 --weekly 4 --monthly 12

Old backups are automatically deleted according to policy.

Private Networking:

Deploy into private VPCs for enhanced security:

nova deploy create --vpc vpc-12345 --subnet subnet-67890

Private deployments are not accessible from public internet.

Deployment Cloning:

Quickly create deployment copies for testing or development:

nova deploy clone deployment-id --name test-deployment --size small

Clones include schema and optionally data.

Improvements:

- Backup speed increased 50% through improved compression
- Deployment startup time reduced by 30%
- CLI command completion for bash and zsh shells
- Better progress indicators for long-running operations
- Enhanced log filtering with regular expression support

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed deployment resize operations on storage-optimized instances
- Resolved CLI authentication issues on Windows
- Corrected backup restore failures when target has different region
- Fixed log timestamp parsing for non-UTC timezones
- Resolved rare deadlock in connection pool management

Security Updates:

- TLS 1.3 support for API connections
- Certificate pinning for enhanced security
- Improved audit logging for administrative actions

Known Issues:

- Cross-region backup restore may timeout for very large deployments (>500GB). Use incremental restore as workaround.

doc-changelog-008,Hotfix: NovaCLI v2.4.1 Connection Pool Fix,"NovaCLI v2.4.1 is a critical hotfix release addressing connection pool exhaustion issues discovered in v2.4.0. All v2.4.0 users should upgrade immediately.

Issue Summary:

Connection Pool Leak in v2.4.0

Severity: Critical

Affected Version: NovaCLI v2.4.0 only

Impact:

Deployments running v2.4.0 may experience:
- Gradual connection pool exhaustion over 24-48 hours
- ""Too many connections"" errors
- Deployment unresponsiveness
- Automatic restarts triggered by health checks

Root Cause:

A regression introduced in v2.4.0 prevents proper connection cleanup when queries are cancelled or timeout. Connections remain in the pool marked as active, gradually exhausting available connections.

Fix Details:

v2.4.1 resolves the issue by:
- Implementing proper connection cleanup in error paths
- Adding connection pool monitoring and alerts
- Introducing connection leak detection
- Enforcing connection idle timeout

Upgrade Instructions:

CLI Upgrade:

nova self-update

Verify version:

nova --version
# Should show: NovaCLI v2.4.1

Deployment Upgrade:

nova deploy upgrade deployment-id --version 2.4.1

Upgrades complete within 2-5 minutes with zero downtime via rolling restart.

Immediate Workaround:

If immediate upgrade is not possible, restart affected deployments to clear connection pool:

nova deploy restart deployment-id

Note: This is a temporary workaround. Upgrade to v2.4.1 as soon as possible.

Verification:

After upgrade, monitor connection pool health:

nova deploy connections deployment-id --pool-stats

Healthy pools show:
- Active connections: < 50% of max
- Idle connections: > 0
- Connection wait time: < 100ms

Rollback:

If issues persist after upgrade, rollback to v2.3.0:

nova deploy rollback deployment-id --target-version 2.3.0

doc-authentication-2.0-keyword_bait,Release Notes: NovaCLI v2.1.0,"NovaCLI v2.1.0 includes critical bug fixes and performance improvements for authentication and database connectivity.

Fixed Issues:

Authentication Bug (Issue #892): Resolved crash when SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication method was enabled for read-only users connecting through connection pools. The error occurred during initial handshake when password encryption settings conflicted with user role definitions. Users affected by this issue should upgrade immediately to prevent connection failures in production environments.

Performance Improvements:

Reduced authentication handshake latency by 35% for certificate-based connections. Optimized token validation cache to minimize round-trips to authentication services. Connection pool warm-up now pre-authenticates background connections during idle periods.

Deprecation Notices:

The --legacy-auth flag will be removed in v3.0. Applications still using MD5 password encryption should migrate to SCRAM-SHA-256 before upgrading to future major versions. Migration documentation will be published with the v3.0 release candidate.

Known Issues:

Authentication timeout settings in config.yaml are not respected when connecting through HTTP proxies. Workaround: Set timeout values directly in connection strings. A fix is planned for v2.2.0.

Upgrade Instructions:

Backup current configuration files before upgrading. Run: nova config backup --output backup.yaml

Install the new version: curl -sSL http://install.nova.io | bash -s v2.1.0

Validate configuration compatibility: nova config validate

Restart all NovaCLI services to apply authentication improvements.

Breaking Changes:

doc-config_format-2.0-keyword_bait,Changelog: TOML Parser Updates in v2.3.0,"NovaCLI v2.3.0 ships with an updated TOML parser library that improves compatibility and error handling for edge cases in configuration file parsing.

Parser Improvements:

Upgraded from toml-rs 0.5.x to 0.7.x, bringing full TOML 1.0 specification compliance. The new parser correctly handles Unicode escape sequences in string values, inline table syntax edge cases, and deeply nested table structures that previously caused parsing failures.

Fixed Issue #1203: TOML configuration files with multiline strings containing backslashes now parse correctly without requiring double-escaping. This resolves configuration loading failures for Windows users with paths like C:Program FilesNovaCLI.

Fixed Issue #1189: Array of tables syntax with mixed inline and standard definitions no longer produces ambiguous parse errors. The parser now provides clear error messages indicating which line contains syntax violations.

Error Message Enhancements:

Parser errors now include line numbers, column positions, and contextual snippets showing the problematic TOML syntax. Example output:

Error: Invalid TOML syntax at line 23, column 15
   21 | [server]
   22 | host = ""http://api.nova.io""
   23 | port = 443invalid
                      ^
Expected newline or comment after value

Performance:

TOML file parsing is now 2.4x faster for large configuration files (>10KB). Memory allocation during parsing reduced by 40% through lazy evaluation of unused configuration sections.

Backward Compatibility:

All valid TOML files that worked with v2.2.x remain compatible. The stricter TOML 1.0 compliance only affects previously malformed files that were accidentally accepted by the lenient parser.

Migration Notes:

If you receive parsing errors after upgrading, validate your configuration file using an external TOML validator. Common issues include:
- Missing quotes around string values with special characters
- Incorrect whitespace in inline tables
- Duplicate key definitions

Known Limitations:

doc-logging-2.0-keyword_bait,Changelog: Logging System Hotfix v2.4.1,"NovaCLI v2.4.1 is a hotfix release addressing critical logging issues discovered in v2.4.0.

Critical Fix:

Fixed Issue #1387: JSON structured logging caused application crashes when log messages contained unescaped control characters. The JSON encoder now properly escapes newlines, tabs, and other control characters in log message fields. This resolves crashes affecting users who enabled JSON logging format in production environments.

Affected Configurations:

Users with logging.format = ""json"" in their configuration files experienced intermittent crashes when application code generated log messages with embedded newlines or unicode control characters. The crash manifested as a panic during JSON serialization with error ""invalid character in string literal.""

Workaround (v2.4.0 users):

Temporarily switch to text format logging: nova config set logging.format text. Upgrade to v2.4.1 as soon as possible to restore JSON logging functionality.

Additional Fixes:

Fixed memory leak in structured logging field allocation. Long-running processes with high log volume no longer accumulate unbounded memory in the logging subsystem. Memory usage now remains constant regardless of log throughput.

Fixed timestamp precision loss in JSON log output. Timestamps now include microsecond precision instead of truncating to milliseconds. This improves log correlation accuracy in distributed tracing scenarios.

Performance Impact:

JSON logging overhead reduced from 8% to 3% of total application CPU usage through optimized serialization paths. High-throughput applications generating >10,000 log entries per second will see noticeable performance improvements.

Upgrade Priority:

HIGH - All users with JSON structured logging enabled should upgrade immediately. Users with text format logging are not affected but should upgrade during next maintenance window.

Verification:

After upgrading, confirm JSON logging works correctly by generating test log entries: nova logs test --format json. Verify output contains properly escaped control characters.

Rollback:

doc-cli_commands-2.0-keyword_bait,Release Notes: NovaCLI v2.5.0 Command Improvements,"NovaCLI v2.5.0 introduces enhancements to command parsing and autocomplete functionality.

Command Parser Updates:

Fixed Issue #1456: The nova config command now correctly handles subcommands with hyphens in their names. Previously, nova config get-all would fail with ""unknown subcommand"" errors. The parser now treats hyphens as valid identifier characters.

Fixed Issue #1502: Command aliases with special characters in arguments no longer cause shell escaping issues. Users can now safely use nova config set with values containing quotes and backslashes without manual escaping.

Autocomplete Enhancements:

Shell completion scripts for Bash, Zsh, and Fish now suggest available subcommands and flags dynamically. Type nova config <TAB> to see all available configuration management commands. Completion includes context-aware suggestions based on previously typed flags.

Performance:

Command parsing latency reduced by 15% through optimized flag validation. Autocomplete response time improved from 120ms to 45ms on average through aggressive caching of command metadata.

New Flags:

Added --dry-run flag to nova config update command, allowing users to preview configuration changes before applying them. Output shows a diff-style comparison of current versus proposed configuration values.

Added --machine-readable flag for JSON output formatting across all nova config subcommands. Useful for scripting and CI/CD pipeline integration where structured output is required.

Deprecation Warnings:

The nova config get command will be replaced with nova config show in v3.0 to maintain naming consistency across the CLI. Both commands will work identically in v2.x releases with deprecation warnings.

Bug Fixes:

Fixed crash when nova config validate was run against configuration files exceeding 5MB. The validator now streams large files instead of loading them entirely into memory.

Fixed incorrect exit codes from nova config subcommands. Commands now properly return non-zero exit codes on failure, enabling better error detection in scripts.

Migration:

doc-env_vars-2.0-keyword_bait,Release Notes: Environment Variable Handling in v2.6.0,"NovaCLI v2.6.0 improves environment variable parsing and introduces new validation features.

Environment Variable Parser Enhancements:

Fixed Issue #1623: Environment variables with NOVA_ prefix are now case-insensitive on Windows platforms. Previously, NOVA_SERVER_HOST and nova_server_host were treated as different variables, causing configuration inconsistencies across operating systems. The parser now normalizes all NOVA_ prefixed variables to uppercase before processing.

Fixed Issue #1701: Environment variables containing equals signs in their values no longer cause parsing failures. For example, NOVA_DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass=word@host now correctly parses the entire connection string including the embedded equals sign in the password.

Validation Improvements:

Added runtime validation for environment variable values. Invalid values now trigger clear error messages at application startup rather than cryptic failures during operation. Boolean variables reject values other than true/false/yes/no/1/0. Numeric variables validate integer and float formats.

New Debug Command:

Added nova env debug command to display all NOVA_ prefixed environment variables currently loaded by the application. Sensitive values matching patterns like TOKEN, PASSWORD, SECRET are automatically redacted in output. Useful for troubleshooting configuration precedence issues.

Performance:

Environment variable lookup performance improved by 3.2x through lazy loading and caching. Applications with hundreds of environment variables see reduced startup time from 450ms to 140ms.

Deprecation Notice:

The legacy NOVACLI_ prefix for environment variables is deprecated and will be removed in v3.0. All configuration should migrate to NOVA_ prefix. Both prefixes work in v2.x with deprecation warnings logged.

Security:

Fixed information disclosure vulnerability where environment variables were logged in plaintext during debug output. All variables matching sensitive patterns are now redacted automatically.

Migration:

doc-changelog-002,Release Notes: NovaCLI v3.0.0,"NovaCLI v3.0.0 marks a major milestone with significant architectural improvements, configuration format changes, and new deployment management capabilities. This release requires migration from v2.x.

Major Changes:

TOML Configuration Format:

Configuration files now use TOML instead of YAML for improved clarity and type safety. The migration tool automatically converts existing configs:

nova config migrate --from-version 2.0

New config location: ~/.nova/config.toml

Command Restructuring:

Commands are reorganized for better discoverability:

- nova config → nova settings (deployment configuration)
- nova db → nova deploy (deployment management)
- nova backup create → nova backup create (unchanged)

Old commands are deprecated but remain functional with warnings.

Advanced Deployment Sizing:

Granular instance sizing replaces the previous three-tier system:

- CPU-optimized instances for compute-heavy workloads
- Memory-optimized instances for large datasets
- Storage-optimized instances for high I/O requirements
- Balanced instances for general purpose

New Features:

Connection Pooling:

Built-in connection pooling improves performance for high-concurrency applications:

nova deploy update deployment-id --enable-connection-pooling --pool-size 100

Query Performance Insights:

Automatic slow query detection and optimization suggestions:

nova deploy query-insights deployment-id

Identifies missing indexes, inefficient joins, and optimization opportunities.

Point-in-Time Recovery:

Restore deployments to any point within retention period:

nova backup restore deployment-id --timestamp ""2024-06-15T14:30:00Z""

Performance Improvements:

- Backup speed increased 3x through parallel processing
- Query planning overhead reduced by 40%
- Network protocol optimization reduces latency by 25%

Deprecations:

- YAML configuration (use TOML migration tool)
- nova config command (use nova settings)
- Legacy authentication method (migrate to token-based auth)

Upgrade Path:

doc-configuration-004,Backup Configuration and Retention,"NovaCLI v3.0 provides automated backup capabilities with configurable retention policies. This guide covers backup configuration, scheduling, and restoration procedures.

Automatic Backup Schedule:

Backups run automatically based on configured schedule:

[backup]
enabled = true
schedule = ""0 2   *""  # Daily at 2 AM UTC
retention_days = 7

Schedule uses cron syntax. The default daily backup suffices for most use cases.

Extended Retention:

Increase retention for compliance or auditing:

nova settings set deployment.<deployment-id>.backup.retention_days 30

Longer retention increases storage costs. Balance compliance needs against budget.

Incremental Backups:

Reduce storage and backup time with incremental backups:

[backup]
incremental_enabled = true
full_backup_interval = 7  # Full backup weekly

Incremental backups capture only changes since last backup.

Backup Windows:

Schedule backups during low-traffic periods:

[backup]
window_start = ""02:00""
window_end = ""06:00""

Backups run only within specified window. Large databases may not complete if window is too short.

Cross-Region Replication:

Store backup copies in different region for disaster recovery:

nova settings set deployment.<deployment-id>.backup.replica_region eu-central-1

Adds redundancy against regional outages. Increases storage costs due to cross-region transfer and duplicate storage.

Manual Backups:

Create on-demand backup before major changes:

nova deploy backup-create <deployment-id> --name ""pre-migration-backup""

Manual backups don't count toward automatic retention limits.

List Backups:

View available backups:

nova deploy backup-list <deployment-id>

Displays backup ID, creation time, size, and type (auto/manual).

Restore from Backup:

Restore replaces current data with backup contents:

nova deploy restore <deployment-id> --backup-id <backup-id>

Confirmation required. Restoration is destructive; current data is lost.

Point-in-Time Recovery:

Restore to specific timestamp:

nova deploy restore <deployment-id> --timestamp ""2024-09-01T14:30:00Z""

Requires point-in-time recovery enabled (additional cost). Resolution: 5 minutes.

Backup Verification:

Test backup integrity:

nova deploy backup-verify <deployment-id> --backup-id <backup-id>

Attempts restoration to temporary deployment, verifies success, then deletes.

Backup Encryption:

Backups are encrypted at rest by default using AES-256. Optionally provide custom encryption key:

[backup]

doc-migration-002,Planning Your v2.x to v3.x Migration,"Migrating from NovaCLI v2.x to v3.x requires planning due to configuration format changes and command restructuring. This guide helps you plan a successful migration strategy.

Migration Timeline:

Recommended migration phases:

Phase 1 (Week 1): Planning and Assessment
- Inventory all deployments and configurations
- Review breaking changes documentation
- Identify custom scripts requiring updates
- Set up test environment

Phase 2 (Week 2): Testing
- Migrate test environment to v3.x
- Validate all operations work correctly
- Update and test custom scripts
- Train team on new commands

Phase 3 (Weeks 3-4): Production Migration
- Migrate non-critical deployments first
- Monitor for issues
- Migrate critical deployments during maintenance windows
- Complete team training

Breaking Changes Overview:

Configuration Format:
v2.x uses YAML, v3.x uses TOML. Automatic migration tool handles conversion.

Command Names:
- nova config → nova settings
- Other commands remain compatible with deprecation warnings

Deployment Sizing:
New granular sizing options (CPU-optimized, memory-optimized, etc.) replace three-tier system. Automatic mapping provided.

Inventorying Resources:

List all deployments:
nova deploy list --format json > deployments-inventory.json

Export configurations:
for deployment in $(nova deploy list --format id); do
  nova deploy get $deployment --format json > config-$deployment.json
done

Risk Assessment:

Low Risk:
- Standard deployments with default configurations
- Deployments using supported features only
- Non-production environments

Medium Risk:
- Deployments with custom configurations
- Integration with external systems
- Production environments with maintenance windows

High Risk:
- Mission-critical 24/7 deployments
- Complex custom configurations
- Tight integration with legacy systems

Rollback Strategy:

Prepare rollback plan:
1. Document pre-migration state
2. Create full backups
3. Test rollback procedure in staging
4. Define rollback triggers (error rates, performance degradation)
5. Establish rollback time limits

Communication Plan:

Stakeholder communication:
- Initial announcement: 4 weeks before migration
- Detailed timeline: 2 weeks before
- Migration window notification: 1 week before
- Day-of updates: Real-time status
- Post-migration review: Within 48 hours

Resource Requirements:

Team:
- Migration lead
- Technical specialists
- Support coverage during migration

Tools:
- Test environment matching production
- Monitoring and alerting
- Communication channels

Time:
- Planning: 1 week
- Testing: 1-2 weeks

doc-authentication-3.1-semantic_bait,Security Best Practices for Read-Only Users,"Securing read-only user accounts is a critical component of database security architecture. While these users cannot modify data, improper configuration can still expose sensitive information or create pathways for privilege escalation attacks.

Read-only users serve a specific purpose in production environments: they enable reporting tools, analytics platforms, and monitoring systems to access data without the risk of accidental or malicious modifications. However, many administrators overlook the security implications of these accounts, treating them as low-priority because they lack write permissions.

The principle of least privilege should guide your approach to read-only account security. Start by ensuring that users can only connect from trusted IP addresses or internal networks. Never expose read-only credentials to public-facing applications or store them in version control systems.

Password policies matter even for read-only accounts. Require strong passwords with a minimum length of 16 characters, combining uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. Rotate credentials quarterly and immediately revoke access when team members change roles or leave the organization.

Network segmentation adds another layer of protection. Place read-only users in separate connection pools with rate limiting to prevent resource exhaustion attacks. Monitor query patterns for anomalies that might indicate credential theft or abuse.

Audit logging is essential for compliance and forensics. Enable detailed connection logs that capture username, source IP, timestamp, and query content. Regularly review these logs for suspicious activity, such as off-hours access or queries targeting sensitive tables.

Consider using certificate-based authentication instead of passwords for automated systems. Certificates provide stronger cryptographic guarantees and eliminate the risk of password reuse across services.

Finally, implement regular access reviews.

doc-configuration-007,High Availability Configuration,"NovaCLI v3.0 deployments support high availability configurations for mission-critical workloads. HA deployments provide automatic failover, zero-downtime maintenance, and improved resilience.

HA Architecture:

HA deployments consist of multiple replicas distributed across availability zones:

[high_availability]
enabled = true
replica_count = 3
min_replicas = 2

Three replicas ensure continued operation if one fails. Minimum two replicas maintains availability during maintenance.

Failover Configuration:

Automatic failover redirects traffic to healthy replicas:

[failover]
auto_failover = true
health_check_interval = 10  # seconds
failover_threshold = 3      # consecutive failures

Replica marked unhealthy after three failed health checks. Traffic routes to remaining replicas.

Load Balancing:

Distribute connections across replicas:

[load_balancing]
strategy = ""least_connections""
session_affinity = false

Strategies: round_robin, least_connections, random. Session affinity pins clients to specific replicas (useful for caching).

Replication Mode:

Configure synchronous or asynchronous replication:

[replication]
mode = ""synchronous""
max_replication_lag = 1000  # milliseconds

Synchronous replication ensures data consistency but increases write latency. Asynchronous improves performance but risks data loss during failover.

Quorum Configuration:

Minimum replicas for write acceptance:

[quorum]
write_quorum = 2
read_quorum = 1

Write quorum of 2 requires two replicas confirm writes. Prevents split-brain scenarios.

Maintenance Windows:

Zero-downtime maintenance:

nova deploy maintenance enable <deployment-id>

Rolling updates apply changes replica-by-replica. Traffic shifts to healthy replicas during updates.

Split-Brain Prevention:

Prevent conflicting primary elections:

[consensus]
algorithm = ""raft""
election_timeout = 5000
heartbeat_interval = 1000

Raft consensus ensures single primary at any time.

Monitoring HA Status:

View replica health:

nova deploy ha-status <deployment-id>

Displays replica status, replication lag, and failover history.

Disaster Recovery:

HA protects against AZ failures. For region-level DR, configure cross-region replicas:

[disaster_recovery]
cross_region_replication = true
dr_region = ""us-west-2""
dr_replica_count = 1

DR replica remains passive unless primary region fails.

Performance Considerations:

HA adds overhead:
- Synchronous replication increases write latency
- Additional replicas increase storage costs
- Network traffic between replicas

Benchmark performance:

nova deploy benchmark <deployment-id> --compare-single-replica

Failover Testing:

Test failover behavior:

doc-getting-started-014,Managing Multiple Profiles,"NovaCLI v3.0 introduced profile support for managing multiple accounts, organizations, or environments from a single installation. Profiles eliminate the need to repeatedly authenticate when switching contexts.

Profiles store authentication credentials, default settings, and frequently used configurations separately. Each profile has a name and can be activated independently.

List existing profiles:

nova profiles list

The active profile is marked with an asterisk.

Create a new profile:

nova profiles create work

This creates an empty profile named ""work"". Authenticate with this profile:

nova auth login --profile work

Provide credentials for your work account. These credentials are stored under the work profile only.

Switch between profiles:

nova profiles use work

All subsequent commands use the work profile's credentials and settings until you switch again.

Create additional profiles for different contexts:

nova profiles create personal
nova auth login --profile personal

nova profiles create staging
nova auth login --profile staging

View which profile is active:

nova profiles current

Each profile can have custom default settings:

nova settings set --profile work default.region us-east-1
nova settings set --profile personal default.region eu-west-2

When creating deployments without specifying a region, NovaCLI uses the active profile's default.

Temporarily use a different profile without switching:

nova --profile personal deploy list

This executes a single command with the personal profile while keeping work as the active profile.

Rename a profile:

nova profiles rename staging production

Delete a profile:

nova profiles delete old-account

This removes stored credentials and settings but doesn't affect deployments created with that profile.

Export profile configuration for backup or sharing:

nova profiles export work --output work-profile.yaml

Import on another machine:

nova profiles import work-profile.yaml

Profile data is stored in ~/.novacli/profiles/ with separate directories for each profile. Credentials are encrypted at rest.

doc-migration-003,Configuration File Migration: YAML to TOML,"NovaCLI v3.0 replaced YAML configuration with TOML for improved clarity and type safety. This guide explains the migration process and highlights key differences.

Automatic Migration:

The migration tool automatically converts YAML to TOML:

nova config migrate --from-version 2.0

This command:
1. Reads existing ~/.nova/config.yaml
2. Converts to TOML format
3. Writes to ~/.nova/config.toml
4. Backs up original YAML file
5. Validates new configuration

Manual Migration:

For custom or complex configurations, manual migration may be preferred.

YAML Example (v2.x):
yaml
defaults:
  region: us-east
  size: large
  backup_enabled: true

api:
  endpoint: https://api.nova.io
  timeout: 30

logging:
  level: info
  file: ~/.nova/logs/cli.log


TOML Equivalent (v3.x):
toml
[defaults]
region = ""us-east""
size = ""large""
backup_enabled = true

[api]
endpoint = ""https://api.nova.io""
timeout = 30

[logging]
level = ""info""
file = ""~/.nova/logs/cli.log""


Key Differences:

Section Headers:
- YAML: section:
- TOML: [section]

String Values:
- YAML: Quotes optional for simple strings
- TOML: Quotes required for strings

Booleans:
- YAML: true, false, yes, no
- TOML: true, false only

Arrays:
- YAML: - item1n  - item2
- TOML: [""item1"", ""item2""]

Nested Configuration:

YAML nested structure:
yaml
deployment:
  production:
    region: us-east
    size: large


TOML nested structure:
toml
[deployment.production]
region = ""us-east""
size = ""large""


Validating Migrated Configuration:

Validate syntax and values:

nova config validate

Check specific settings:

nova config get defaults.region

Common Migration Issues:

Issue: Boolean conversion errors
Cause: YAML yes/no not valid TOML
Solution: Migration tool converts to true/false automatically

Issue: Multiline strings
Cause: Different multiline syntax
Solution: TOML uses triple quotes for multiline strings

Issue: Comments
Cause: Comment syntax differs
Solution: YAML uses #, TOML uses #. Migration preserves comments.

Reverting to YAML:

If needed, keep v2.x CLI installed alongside v3.x:

alias nova2='/usr/local/bin/nova-v2'

doc-configuration-022,API Gateway Configuration,"NovaCLI v3.0 includes an integrated API gateway for managing external API access to deployments. This guide covers gateway configuration, rate limiting, and authentication.

Gateway Activation:

Enable API gateway:

[api_gateway]
enabled = true
port = 8443
bind_address = ""0.0.0.0""

Gateway proxies requests to backend deployments.

Route Configuration:

Define API routes:

[api_gateway.routes]

[[api_gateway.routes.route]]
path = ""/api/v1/deployments""
backend = ""http://deployment-service:8080""
methods = [""GET"", ""POST""]
authentication_required = true

[[api_gateway.routes.route]]
path = ""/api/v1/metrics""
backend = ""http://metrics-service:9090""
methods = [""GET""]
authentication_required = false

Path Rewriting:

Rewrite paths before forwarding:

[api_gateway.rewrite]
""/api/v1/"" = ""/internal/v1/""
""/public/"" = ""/""

Upstream requests use rewritten paths.

Load Balancing:

Distribute across multiple backends:

[[api_gateway.routes.route]]
path = ""/api/v1/deployments""
backends = [
  ""http://backend1:8080"",
  ""http://backend2:8080"",
  ""http://backend3:8080""
]
load_balance_strategy = ""round_robin""  # or ""least_connections"", ""ip_hash""

Health Checks:

Monitor backend health:

[api_http://gateway.health_checks]
enabled = true
interval = 10  # seconds
timeout = 5
unhealthy_threshold = 3
healthy_threshold = 2
path = ""/health""

Unhealthy backends excluded from rotation.

Request Rate Limiting:

Limit request rates per client:

[api_gateway.rate_limiting]
enabled = true
requests_per_minute = 100
burst_size = 20
identifier = ""ip_address""  # or ""api_key"", ""jwt_subject""

Tier-based limits:

[api_gateway.rate_limiting.tiers]
free = 60
basic = 300
premium = 1000

Authentication:

Multiple authentication methods:

[api_gateway.authentication]

[[api_gateway.authentication.jwt]]
enabled = true
secret = ""${JWT_SECRET}""
token_header = ""Authorization""
token_prefix = ""Bearer""

[[api_gateway.authentication.api_key]]
enabled = true
header = ""X-API-Key""
query_param = ""api_key""

CORS Configuration:

Configure cross-origin requests:

[api_gateway.cors]
enabled = true
allowed_origins = [""https://app.company.com"", ""https://dashboard.company.com""]
allowed_methods = [""GET"", ""POST"", ""PUT"", ""DELETE""]
allowed_headers = [""Content-Type"", ""Authorization""]
max_age = 3600

Request/Response Transformation:

Modify requests and responses:

[api_gateway.transformations]

[[api_gateway.transformations.request]]
add_headers = {""X-Gateway"" = ""NovaCLI""}
remove_headers = [""X-Internal""]

[[api_gateway.transformations.response]]
add_headers = {""X-Response-Time"" = ""${response_time_ms}""}

Circuit Breaker:

Prevent cascading failures:

[api_gateway.circuit_breaker]
enabled = true
failure_threshold = 5
timeout = 10  # seconds
reset_timeout = 60

Opens circuit after consecutive failures.

Request Logging:

Log all gateway requests:

[api_gateway.logging]
enabled = true
log_headers = true
log_body = false
log_response_time = true

Caching:

Cache responses at gateway:

[api_gateway.cache]
enabled = true
ttl = 60  # seconds
cache_methods = [""GET""]
cache_status_codes = [200]

Retry Policy:

Retry failed requests:

[api_gateway.retry]
enabled = true
max_attempts = 3
retry_on_status = [502, 503, 504]
backoff_strategy = ""exponential""

WebSocket Support:

Proxy WebSocket connections:

[api_gateway.websocket]
enabled = true
upgrade_header = ""Upgrade""
connection_header = ""Connection""

Metrics and Monitoring:

Expose gateway metrics:

[api_gateway.metrics]
enabled = true
request_count = true
response_time = true

doc-migration-004,Migrating Custom Scripts and Automation,"Organizations using custom scripts and automation with NovaCLI must update these tools when migrating to v3.x. This guide identifies common patterns requiring updates.

Command Name Changes:

Primary changes in v3.0:

v2.x: nova config <subcommand>
v3.x: nova settings <subcommand>

v2.x commands still work with deprecation warnings until v4.0.

Updating Scripts:

Find affected commands:

grep -r ""nova config"" /path/to/scripts/

Update with sed:

sed -i 's/nova config/nova settings/g' /path/to/scripts/*.sh

Output Format Changes:

JSON output structure is unchanged. Scripts parsing JSON output require no modifications.

Human-readable output may differ. Scripts parsing human-readable output should switch to --format json.

Before (v2.x):
nova deploy list | awk '{print $1}'

After (v3.x):
nova deploy list --format json | jq -r '.[].id'

Environment Variables:

All v2.x environment variables work in v3.x:
- NOVA_API_TOKEN
- NOVA_API_ENDPOINT
- NOVA_CONFIG_PATH
- NOVA_LOG_LEVEL

New v3.x variables:
- NOVA_OUTPUT_FORMAT: Default output format (json, yaml, table)
- NOVA_TIMEOUT: Global operation timeout

Exit Codes:

Exit codes remain consistent:
- 0: Success
- 1: General error
- 2: Invalid usage
- 3: Authentication error
- 4: Resource not found

API Compatibility:

REST API v3 is fully compatible with v2 API calls. Existing API integrations work without modification.

New v3 endpoints provide enhanced functionality but are optional.

CI/CD Pipeline Updates:

GitHub Actions example:

yaml
steps:
  - name: Install NovaCLI
    run: |
      curl -sSL https://install.nova.io | bash
      nova --version
  
  - name: Authenticate
    run: nova auth login --token $ secrets.NOVA_API_TOKEN 
  
  - name: Deploy
    run: nova deploy upgrade $ vars.DEPLOYMENT_ID  --version 3.1


No changes needed for v3.x compatibility.

Testing Automation:

Create test script:

bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Test deployment creation
nova deploy create --name test-migration --size small

# Test configuration
nova settings get test-deployment

# Test cleanup
nova deploy delete test-deployment --confirm

echo ""All tests passed""


Run against v3.x test environment before production migration.

Documenting Changes:

Maintain migration log:
- Scripts updated
- Changes made
- Testing results

doc-configuration-013,Custom Command Aliases,"NovaCLI v3.0 allows defining custom command aliases to simplify common workflows and reduce typing. This guide covers alias creation, management, and best practices.

Basic Alias Definition:

Define aliases in configuration:

[aliases]
ls = ""deploy list""
stat = ""deploy stats""
logs = ""logs tail""

Use aliases like built-in commands:

nova ls
nova stat <deployment-id>
nova logs <deployment-id>

Aliases with Arguments:

Pass arguments through to underlying command:

[aliases]
quick-deploy = ""deploy create --size small --region us-east-1""

Invoke with additional arguments:

nova quick-deploy --name my-deployment

Expands to:

nova deploy create --size small --region us-east-1 --name my-deployment

Parameterized Aliases:

Use placeholders for dynamic values:

[aliases]
restart = ""deploy stop $1 && deploy start $1""
scale = ""deploy update $1 --size $2""

Positional parameters:

nova restart my-deployment
nova scale my-deployment large

Chained Commands:

Execute multiple commands sequentially:

[aliases]
full-status = ""deploy list && deploy stats $1 && logs tail $1 --lines 20""

Commands separated by && execute if previous succeeds.

Conditional Execution:

Execute based on success or failure:

[aliases]
safe-restart = ""deploy backup-create $1 && deploy restart $1 || echo Restart failed""

|| executes right side if left fails.

Shell Command Integration:

Execute shell commands within aliases:

[aliases]
local-backup = ""!tar czf backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /var/lib/nova""

! prefix indicates shell command, not NovaCLI command.

Environment Variable Substitution:

Reference environment variables:

[aliases]
prod-deploy = ""deploy create --config ${PROD_CONFIG_PATH} --env production""

Variables expand at execution time.

Global vs Profile Aliases:

Global aliases available in all profiles:

[aliases]
status = ""deploy list""

Profile-specific aliases:

nova settings set --profile production alias.quick-restart ""deploy restart $1 --force""

Alias Listing:

View defined aliases:

nova alias list

Displays alias name and expansion.

Alias Removal:

Delete alias:

nova alias remove quick-deploy

Or edit configuration file directly.

Alias Precedence:

Resolution order:
1. Built-in commands
2. Profile-specific aliases
3. Global aliases
4. Plugins

Aliases cannot override built-in commands.

Sharing Aliases:

Teams can standardize aliases:

# team-aliases.toml
[aliases]
deploy-prod = ""deploy create --config prod.toml --backup-before""
deploy-staging = ""deploy create --config staging.toml""

Import shared aliases:

nova settings load --merge team-aliases.toml

Alias Best Practices:

- Keep aliases short and memorable
- Document complex aliases in comments
- Avoid deeply nested alias chains
- Test aliases before sharing with team
- Use descriptive names for infrequently used aliases

Debugging Aliases:

Show alias expansion without executing:

doc-migration-005,Rolling Back Failed Migrations,"Migration rollback procedures help recover from unexpected issues during v2.x to v3.x migration. This guide covers rollback strategies and execution.

When to Rollback:

Consider rollback if:
- Deployment health checks fail after upgrade
- Performance degradation exceeds 20%
- Critical functionality breaks
- Data inconsistencies appear
- Upgrade exceeds maximum time window

Quick Rollback Decision Matrix:

Impact Severity vs Time Elapsed:
- Critical + <1 hour: Rollback immediately
- Critical + >1 hour: Investigate, rollback if no fix within 30 min
- High + <2 hours: Attempt fix, rollback if unsuccessful
- Medium: Monitor, schedule maintenance for fix
- Low: Document, fix in next maintenance window

Pre-Rollback Checks:

Before rolling back:
1. Capture logs and error messages
2. Document the issue thoroughly
3. Verify backup integrity
4. Notify stakeholders
5. Ensure rollback window availability

CLI Rollback:

Rollback CLI to v2.x:

Linux/macOS:
curl -sSL https://install.nova.io/v2 | bash

Windows:
Download v2.x installer from https://downloads.nova.io/v2/

Verify rollback:
nova --version
# Should show v2.x

Deployment Rollback:

Rollback individual deployment:

nova deploy rollback deployment-id --target-version 2.6

Rollback completes in 2-5 minutes using previous version snapshot.

Batch rollback:

for deployment in $(cat deployment-list.txt); do
  nova deploy rollback $deployment --target-version 2.6
  echo ""Rolled back $deployment""
done

Configuration Rollback:

Restore v2.x YAML configuration:

mv ~/.nova/config.toml ~/.nova/config.toml.backup
mv ~/.nova/config.yaml.backup ~/.nova/config.yaml

Verify:
nova config validate

Verifying Rollback Success:

Post-rollback checks:
1. Verify CLI version
2. Test deployment connectivity
3. Run health checks
4. Verify functionality
5. Monitor for 1 hour

Health check:
nova deploy health deployment-id

Data Integrity:

Verify data integrity after rollback:

1. Run integrity checks:
   nova deploy check-integrity deployment-id

2. Compare record counts
3. Validate critical data
4. Test application functionality

Post-Rollback Actions:

1. Document rollback reason
2. Analyze failure cause
3. Update migration plan
4. Schedule retry after fixes
5. Communicate status to stakeholders

Preventing Future Rollbacks:

Improve success rate:
- More thorough testing in staging
- Gradual rollout (start with non-critical deployments)
- Extended monitoring periods
- Better rollback criteria definition
- Improved team training

Re-attempting Migration:

After rollback and fixes:
1. Wait minimum 24 hours
2. Review and address root cause
3. Re-test in staging
4. Update migration procedures
5. Schedule new migration window

doc-configuration-024,Regional Configuration,"NovaCLI v3.0 supports multi-region deployments with region-specific configuration. This guide covers configuring region preferences, latency optimization, and data residency.

Default Region:

Set preferred deployment region:

[regions]
default = ""us-east-1""
fallback = ""us-west-2""

All deployments use default unless overridden.

Available Regions:

NovaCLI supports these regions:

North America:
- us-east-1 (Virginia)
- us-west-2 (Oregon)
- ca-central-1 (Canada)

Europe:
- eu-west-1 (Ireland)
- eu-central-1 (Frankfurt)

Asia Pacific:
- ap-southeast-1 (Singapore)
- ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo)

Query available regions:

nova regions list

Region-Specific Settings:

Configure per-region overrides:

[http://regions.us-east-1]
availability_zones = [""us-east-1a"", ""us-east-1b"", ""us-east-1c""]
default_size = ""large""
backup_region = ""us-west-2""

[http://regions.eu-central-1]
availability_zones = [""eu-central-1a"", ""eu-central-1b""]
default_size = ""medium""
backup_region = ""eu-west-1""

Multi-Region Deployments:

Deploy to multiple regions:

nova deploy create-multi 
  --name global-app 
  --regions us-east-1,eu-west-1,ap-southeast-1 
  --replication synchronous

Replication modes:
- synchronous: All regions updated simultaneously
- asynchronous: Primary updates immediately, replicas eventually

Region Selection Strategy:

Automatic region selection:

[regions.selection]
strategy = ""latency""  # or ""cost"", ""compliance""
latency_threshold_ms = 100

Latency strategy selects nearest region.

Data Residency:

Enforce data residency requirements:

[regions.compliance]
data_residency_regions = [""eu-west-1"", ""eu-central-1""]
prohibited_regions = [""us-east-1""]

EU data stays in EU for GDPR compliance.

Cross-Region Traffic:

Configure cross-region routing:

[regions.routing]
cross_region_enabled = true
prefer_local_region = true
failover_to_nearest = true

Fails over to nearest healthy region.

Region Affinity:

Pin users to specific regions:

[regions.affinity]
enabled = true
affinity_key = ""user_id""
sticky_region = true

Same user always routed to same region.

Latency Monitoring:

Monitor inter-region latency:

[regions.monitoring]
latency_checks = true
check_interval = 60  # seconds
alert_threshold_ms = 200

Region Costs:

View region pricing:

nova regions pricing

Compare costs:

nova deploy cost-estimate 
  --size large 
  --regions us-east-1,eu-west-1

Region Failover:

Configure automatic failover:

[regions.failover]
auto_failover = true
failover_threshold = 3  # consecutive failures
failover_delay = 30  # seconds

Test failover:

nova deploy failover-test <deployment-id>

Region Quotas:

View region quotas:

nova regions quota us-east-1

Region limits:
- max_deployments
- max_connections
- max_storage_gb

Region Maintenance:

Scheduled maintenance windows:

nova regions maintenance

Displays upcoming maintenance by region.

Migrate regions:

nova deploy migrate <deployment-id> --to-region eu-west-1

Region Performance:

Benchmark region performance:

nova regions benchmark --regions us-east-1,us-west-2

Measures latency, throughput, and IOPS.

Geographic Load Balancing:

Route to nearest region:

[regions.geo_lb]
enabled = true
routing_policy = ""geoproximity""
health_check_enabled = true

DNS Configuration:

Configure global DNS:

[regions.dns]
global_endpoint = ""http://global.app.company.com""

doc-migration-007,Database Schema Changes During Migration,"Deployment upgrades may include schema changes requiring special handling. This guide covers schema migration patterns and best practices for NovaCLI version upgrades.

Understanding Schema Changes:

Schema changes include:
- New columns or tables
- Modified column types
- Index additions or modifications
- Constraint changes
- Default value updates

Major version upgrades (v1→v2, v2→v3) may include schema changes. Minor versions (v3.0→v3.1) rarely change schemas.

Automatic Schema Migration:

NovaCLI handles most schema changes automatically during deployment upgrade:

nova deploy upgrade deployment-id --version 3.0

During upgrade:
1. Deployment enters maintenance mode
2. Schema changes applied
3. Data migrated to new schema
4. Indexes rebuilt
5. Deployment returns to normal operation

Manual Schema Validation:

Before upgrading, validate schema compatibility:

nova deploy validate-upgrade deployment-id --target-version 3.0

This dry-run identifies potential issues:
- Incompatible data types
- Constraint violations
- Missing required data
- Space requirements

Handling Large Deployments:

Schema changes on large deployments (>500GB) require extended time:

1. Estimate migration time:
   nova deploy estimate-upgrade deployment-id --target-version 3.0

2. Schedule adequate maintenance window

3. Increase timeout:
   nova deploy upgrade deployment-id --version 3.0 --timeout 7200

Data Type Migrations:

Some upgrades change column data types. Example: v2.0 changed timestamp storage from UNIX epoch to ISO-8601.

Automatic conversion handles:
- Numeric to string conversions
- Timestamp format changes
- Boolean representation changes

Backup Before Schema Changes:

Always backup before schema-changing upgrades:

nova backup create deployment-id --label ""pre-v3-upgrade""

Verify backup:
nova backup verify backup-id

Rolling Back Schema Changes:

If upgrade fails mid-schema-change, automatic rollback restores previous schema:

nova deploy rollback deployment-id

Rollback works if:
- Migration hasn't completed
- Pre-upgrade snapshot exists
- No manual schema changes made during migration

Testing Schema Migrations:

Test schema changes in staging:

1. Clone production to staging:
   nova deploy clone production-id --name staging-upgrade-test

2. Upgrade clone:
   nova deploy upgrade staging-upgrade-test --version 3.0

3. Verify functionality

4. Delete test clone:
   nova deploy delete staging-upgrade-test

Post-Migration Validation:

After schema migration, validate data integrity:

1. Row counts:
   nova deploy query deployment-id --query ""SELECT COUNT() FROM critical_table""

2. Data samples:
   nova deploy query deployment-id --query ""SELECT  FROM users LIMIT 10""

3. Application testing:
   Run end-to-end application tests

Performance After Schema Changes:

Schema changes may affect performance temporarily:
- Index rebuilds in progress
- Query plan updates

doc-migration-010,Migrating Large-Scale Deployments,"Enterprise deployments with large data volumes require specialized migration strategies. This guide addresses challenges specific to large-scale NovaCLI migrations.

Defining Large-Scale:

Large-scale deployments typically have:
- Data volume: >500GB
- Query volume: >10,000 queries/minute
- User base: >1,000 concurrent users
- Uptime requirements: 99.9%+
- Multiple regions or availability zones

Unique Challenges:

1. Extended migration times:
   Schema changes on 1TB database may take 2-4 hours

2. Data transfer overhead:
   Moving large datasets between instances

3. Downtime sensitivity:
   High-availability requirements

4. Testing complexity:
   Difficult to replicate production scale

5. Rollback risk:
   Longer rollback times

Pre-Migration Optimization:

Reduce migration time:

1. Archive old data:
   nova deploy archive deployment-id --table logs --older-than 365d

2. Remove unused indexes:
   nova deploy indexes deployment-id --unused

3. Vacuum database:
   nova deploy vacuum deployment-id --full

4. Optimize tables:
   nova deploy optimize deployment-id

Phased Migration:

Migrate in phases to reduce risk:

Phase 1: Non-production environments
- Development
- Testing
- Staging

Learn from these migrations before production.

Phase 2: Read replicas
- Upgrade replicas first
- Validate upgraded replicas
- No impact on primary

Phase 3: Regional rollout
- Migrate one region at a time
- Monitor each region before proceeding
- Gradual global rollout

Phase 4: Primary deployment
- Migrate primary last
- All replicas already upgraded
- Shortest primary downtime

Resource Provisioning:

Temporarily over-provision during migration:

1. Increase deployment size:
   nova deploy resize deployment-id --size 2xlarge

2. Additional IOPS:
   nova deploy update deployment-id --iops 10000

3. More parallel workers:
   nova deploy update deployment-id --migration-workers 8

4. After migration, downsize if appropriate

Data Transfer Acceleration:

Speed up large data transfers:

1. Use parallel transfer:
   nova deploy replicate source-id --target target-id --parallel 8

2. Compression:
   nova deploy replicate source-id --target target-id --compress

3. Incremental sync:
   Transfer bulk data first, then sync delta during final cutover

Monitoring Large Migrations:

Detailed progress tracking:

1. Migration progress:
   nova deploy upgrade-status deployment-id

2. Estimated completion:
   Shows time remaining

3. Resource utilization:
   Monitor CPU, memory, disk I/O during migration

4. Lock monitoring:
   Ensure migration isn't blocking critical operations

Rollback Planning:

Large deployment rollback considerations:

1. Pre-migration snapshot:
   May be very large (100s of GB)

2. Rollback time:
   Proportional to data size

3. RPO/RTO:
   Define acceptable data loss and downtime

4. Partial rollback:
   May roll back per-region or per-replica

Stakeholder Communication:

Frequent updates for large migrations:

- T-30 days: Initial announcement
- T-14 days: Detailed plan
- T-7 days: Reminder
- T-1 day: Final confirmation
- During: Hourly updates
- Post: Completion report

Contingency Planning:

Prepare for extended migrations:

1. Extended maintenance window:
   Plan for 2x estimated time

2. Support coverage:
   24/7 support during migration period

3. Emergency contacts:
   Escalation path for critical issues

doc-configuration-027,Cost Management Configuration,"NovaCLI v3.0 provides cost management features to monitor, optimize, and control cloud spending. This guide covers cost tracking, budgets, and optimization recommendations.

Cost Tracking:

Enable cost tracking:

[cost_management]
tracking_enabled = true
granularity = ""hourly""  # or ""daily"", ""monthly""
currency = ""USD""

View current costs:

nova cost current <deployment-id>

Displays costs by resource type.

Budgets:

Set spending budgets:

[cost_management.budgets]

[[cost_management.budgets.budget]]
name = ""Monthly Production""
amount = 5000
period = ""monthly""
alert_threshold = 0.80  # Alert at 80%
hard_limit = false

[[cost_management.budgets.budget]]
name = ""Development""
amount = 500
period = ""monthly""
hard_limit = true  # Block spending over budget

Budget Alerts:

Configure budget notifications:

[cost_management.alerts]
channels = [""email"", ""slack""]
thresholds = [0.50, 0.75, 0.90, 1.00]
recipients = [""mailto:finops@company.com""]

Cost Allocation:

Allocate costs to teams or projects:

[cost_management.allocation]
tags = [""team"", ""project"", ""environment""]
auto_tag = true

Tag deployments:

nova deploy update <deployment-id> 
  --tag team=engineering 
  --tag project=api-platform

Cost Reports:

Generate cost reports:

nova cost report 
  --period monthly 
  --group-by project 
  --format pdf

Schedule automatic reports:

[cost_management.reporting]
auto_generate = true
frequency = ""weekly""
recipients = [""mailto:finance@company.com""]

Cost Forecasting:

Forecast future costs:

nova cost forecast 
  --horizon 90 
  --confidence 0.95

Based on historical usage patterns.

Cost Optimization:

Receive optimization recommendations:

nova cost optimize <deployment-id>

Recommendations include:
- Rightsizing opportunities
- Reserved capacity
- Idle resource cleanup
- Storage optimization

Rightsizing:

Automatic rightsizing:

[cost_management.rightsizing]
enabled = true
analysis_period_days = 30
utilization_threshold = 0.60
auto_apply = false  # Recommend only

Reserved Capacity:

Manage reserved capacity:

[cost_management.reservations]
auto_recommend = true
min_coverage = 0.70
commitment_term = 12  # months

Purchase reservations:

nova cost reserve 
  --size large 
  --quantity 5 
  --term 12

Cost Anomaly Detection:

Detect unusual spending:

[cost_management.anomaly_detection]
enabled = true
sensitivity = ""medium""  # or ""low"", ""high""
alert_on_anomaly = true

Idle Resource Cleanup:

Identify idle resources:

nova cost idle-resources 
  --min-idle-days 30

Automatic cleanup:

[cost_management.cleanup]
auto_cleanup = false
idle_threshold_days = 60
require_approval = true

Cost by Environment:

Track costs by environment:

nova cost breakdown 
  --by environment 
  --period monthly

Storage Optimization:

Optimize storage costs:

[cost_http://management.storage]
auto_compress = true
archive_old_backups = true
archive_after_days = 90

Cost Showback:

Showback reports for internal billing:

nova cost showback 
  --team engineering 
  --period monthly

Cost Governance:

Enforce cost policies:

[cost_management.governance]
max_deployment_cost_per_day = 100
require_budget_tag = true
block_expensive_operations = false

Export cost data:

nova cost export

doc-migration-012,Compliance and Regulatory Considerations,"Version migrations may impact compliance posture. This guide addresses regulatory considerations for NovaCLI migrations in regulated industries.

Regulatory Frameworks:

Common regulations affecting deployments:
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- SOC 2 (Service Organization Control 2)
- PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
- ISO 27001

Data Residency:

Version migration must maintain data location requirements:

1. Verify region compliance:
   nova regions list --compliance gdpr

2. Check deployment location:
   nova deploy get deployment-id --format json | jq '.region'

3. Ensure migration doesn't move data to non-compliant region

GDPR Considerations:

GDPR requirements during migration:

1. Data protection:
   - Maintain encryption in transit and at rest
   - No unauthorized data transfers
   - Audit logging of data access

2. Right to erasure:
   - Ensure deletion capabilities remain functional
   - Verify backup retention policies

3. Data breach notification:
   - Monitor for anomalies during migration
   - Report any data exposure within 72 hours

HIPAA Requirements:

Healthcare data migrations:

1. Business Associate Agreement (BAA):
   Verify Nova has valid BAA before migration

2. Encryption:
   - All data encrypted during transfer
   - Encrypted backups
   - Secure deletion of old data

3. Access controls:
   - Maintain role-based access
   - Audit trail of all access
   - No unauthorized access during migration

4. Minimum necessary principle:
   Only migrate data required for operations

SOC 2 Compliance:

Maintain SOC 2 controls during migration:

1. Change management:
   - Documented migration plan
   - Approval from stakeholders
   - Testing in non-production

2. Availability:
   - Minimize downtime
   - Redundancy during migration
   - Incident response plan

3. Confidentiality:
   - Access controls maintained
   - Data classification respected
   - Secure communication channels

Documentation Requirements:

Maintain compliance documentation:

1. Migration plan:
   - Scope and objectives
   - Risk assessment
   - Security controls
   - Rollback procedures

2. Execution log:
   - Actions taken
   - Timestamps
   - Personnel involved
   - Issues and resolutions

3. Validation reports:
   - Testing results
   - Security scans
   - Data integrity checks
   - Sign-off from compliance team

Audit Trails:

Maintain audit logs during migration:

nova account audit-log --since migration-start --until migration-end

Capture:
- Administrative actions
- Data access
- Configuration changes
- Security events

Retain audit logs per compliance requirements (typically 1-7 years).

Risk Assessment:

Document migration risks:

1. Data loss or corruption
2. Unauthorized access
3. Compliance violation
4. Service disruption
5. Data breach

Mitigation for each risk.

Third-Party Audits:

Coordinate with auditors:

1. Notify auditors of planned migration
2. Provide migration documentation
3. Address audit findings before migration
4. Schedule post-migration audit review

Incident Response:

Prepare for compliance incidents:

1. Incident response team on standby
2. Notification procedures documented
3. Evidence preservation plan

doc-migration-014,Migration Cost Estimation and Budgeting,"Understanding migration costs helps with planning and budget allocation. This guide covers cost components and estimation methods for NovaCLI version migrations.

Direct Migration Costs:

Infrastructure costs during migration:

1. Temporary resource scaling:
   - Larger instance sizes during migration
   - Additional IOPS provisioning
   - Estimated cost: $50-500 per deployment

2. Dual deployment periods:
   - Running old and new versions simultaneously
   - Blue-green deployment costs
   - Duration: Hours to days
   - Estimated cost: 2x normal infrastructure cost

3. Data transfer:
   - Cross-region migration fees
   - Backup data transfer
   - Estimated: $0.02-0.12 per GB

4. Additional storage:
   - Pre-migration backups
   - Migration snapshots
   - Temporary data duplication
   - Estimated: 1.5-2x normal storage cost

Labor Costs:

Personnel time investment:

1. Planning:
   - Migration strategy development
   - Risk assessment
   - Timeline creation
   - Estimated: 20-40 hours

2. Testing:
   - Staging environment setup
   - Migration testing
   - Validation procedures
   - Estimated: 40-80 hours

3. Execution:
   - Migration day activities
   - Monitoring
   - Issue resolution
   - Estimated: 8-24 hours

4. Post-migration:
   - Validation
   - Documentation
   - Team training
   - Estimated: 20-40 hours

Total labor: 88-184 hours per major migration

Tool and Service Costs:

Additional expenses:

1. Monitoring tools:
   - Enhanced monitoring during migration
   - Third-party APM tools
   - Estimated: $100-1,000

2. Testing environments:
   - Temporary staging deployments
   - Load testing services
   - Estimated: $200-2,000

3. Professional services:
   - Nova migration support (optional)
   - Consulting services
   - Estimated: $5,000-50,000 for large migrations

4. Training:
   - Team training materials
   - Workshops or courses
   - Estimated: $500-5,000

Risk and Contingency:

Budget for unexpected costs:

1. Extended migration time:

doc-troubleshooting-007,Recovering from Configuration File Corruption,"Configuration file corruption in NovaCLI v3.0 can prevent the tool from functioning correctly. Understanding config file structure and recovery procedures helps restore functionality quickly.

Symptoms of Corruption:

Corrupted configuration files cause various errors:

- ""Failed to parse configuration file""
- ""Invalid TOML syntax at line X""
- ""Unknown configuration key: [section.key]""
- Unexpected behavior or ignored settings

Configuration File Locations:

NovaCLI v3.0 stores configuration in:

Linux/macOS: ~/.nova/config.toml
Windows: %USERPROFILE%.novaconfig.toml

Backup your configuration before making changes.

Validating Configuration:

Validate configuration syntax without applying changes:

nova config validate

This reports syntax errors, invalid values, and deprecated settings.

Manual Recovery:

If validation fails and NovaCLI won't start, manually edit the configuration file. Open in a text editor and look for:

- Incomplete lines or missing closing brackets
- Incorrect TOML syntax (missing quotes, invalid escaping)
- Duplicate section headers
- Invalid values for known settings

Comment out problematic lines with # and retry validation.

Reset to Defaults:

If manual recovery fails, reset to default configuration:

mv ~/.nova/config.toml ~/.nova/config.toml.backup
nova config init

This creates a fresh configuration file. You'll need to reconfigure authentication and custom settings.

Restore from Backup:

NovaCLI automatically backs up configuration before major changes. Restore the most recent backup:

ls -lt ~/.nova/backups/
cp ~/.nova/backups/config.toml.2024-09-01 ~/.nova/config.toml

Migration Issues:

Configuration corruption often occurs during version migrations. NovaCLI v3.0 uses TOML instead of YAML from v2.0. If upgrading from v2.0, run the migration tool:

nova config migrate --from-version 2.0

This converts YAML configuration to TOML format, preserving all settings.

Environment Variables:

By-pass corrupted configuration files using environment variables for critical settings:

export NOVA_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.nova.io

doc-config_format-3.1-semantic_bait,Configuration Management Best Practices,"Effective configuration management is the foundation of maintainable infrastructure. Whether you're deploying to production or managing development environments, a well-structured configuration strategy prevents errors, speeds up troubleshooting, and enables rapid scaling.

Configuration files serve as the contract between your application and its runtime environment. They define how services communicate, where data persists, and what security policies apply. Poor configuration practices lead to incidents: production outages from missing environment variables, security breaches from hardcoded credentials, and deployment failures from format inconsistencies.

Start by separating configuration from code. Never embed environment-specific values directly in application logic. Use external configuration files that can be swapped during deployment without recompiling or restarting services. This separation enables the same codebase to run in development, staging, and production with different behavior.

Version control your configuration files alongside code, but treat secrets differently. Store non-sensitive defaults in repositories while injecting sensitive values through environment variables, secret managers, or encrypted vaults. Document which values require customization for each environment.

Structure configuration hierarchically. Group related settings into logical sections: server connection parameters, authentication settings, logging configuration, and feature flags. Clear organization makes it easier for team members to locate and modify specific values without hunting through flat key-value lists.

Validate configuration before deployment. Implement schema validation that catches typos, missing required fields, and invalid value ranges. Automated validation in CI/CD pipelines prevents broken configurations from reaching production.

Maintain multiple environment profiles within configuration systems. Development environments need verbose logging and relaxed timeouts, while production demands optimized performance and strict security. Profile-based configuration eliminates the need for separate files per environment.

Document configuration options thoroughly. Each setting should have clear descriptions, valid value ranges, default behaviors, and examples.

doc-logging-3.1-semantic_bait,Observability and Monitoring Strategies,"Modern applications require comprehensive observability to maintain reliability, diagnose issues, and optimize performance. Effective monitoring strategies combine metrics, logs, and traces to provide complete visibility into system behavior across distributed architectures.

Observability differs from traditional monitoring by focusing on understanding system state from external outputs rather than predicting failure modes in advance. You cannot anticipate every possible failure scenario, but observable systems allow engineers to ask arbitrary questions about behavior when incidents occur.

Logs provide the narrative of what happened in your application. Every significant action, error condition, and state transition should generate a log entry with sufficient context for later investigation. Logs answer questions about specific requests, user actions, and error sequences that metrics alone cannot capture.

Structured logging transforms logs from unstructured text into queryable data. Instead of parsing free-form messages with regular expressions, structured logs use consistent key-value pairs that enable powerful aggregation and filtering. Query languages designed for structured data make it trivial to find patterns across millions of log entries.

Log aggregation centralizes logs from distributed services into a single queryable system. Centralized logging enables correlation across service boundaries, revealing how a single user request flows through multiple microservices and where failures occur in complex workflows.

Metrics complement logs by tracking quantitative measurements over time: request rates, error counts, latency percentiles, resource utilization. While logs capture individual events, metrics reveal trends and patterns that inform capacity planning and performance optimization.

Tracing connects related events across service boundaries using correlation IDs. A single API request might trigger dozens of internal service calls, database queries, and external API requests. Distributed tracing reconstructs the complete execution path, showing where time is spent and where errors originate.

Alerting transforms observability data into actionable notifications.

doc-env_vars-3.1-semantic_bait,Twelve-Factor App Configuration Principles,"The twelve-factor methodology provides time-tested principles for building modern, cloud-native applications that scale horizontally, deploy reliably, and maintain portability across execution environments. Factor III focuses on configuration management, one of the most critical aspects of application design.

Configuration comprises everything that varies between deployments: database credentials, API endpoints, feature flags, resource limits, and external service URLs. The fundamental principle is strict separation of config from code. Configuration should never be hardcoded in source files or checked into version control alongside application logic.

Environment variables provide the simplest and most portable configuration mechanism. They work identically across operating systems, container platforms, and cloud providers. Unlike configuration files that require filesystem access and parsing, environment variables are available through standard language APIs from process startup.

Grouping configuration into named environments (development, staging, production) represents an anti-pattern according to twelve-factor principles. Environment-based grouping doesn't scale as deployments multiply: you'll eventually need production-europe, production-asia, staging-customer-a configurations that don't fit the original three-environment model. Instead, manage configuration granularly with independent variables.

Language and framework-agnostic configuration enables polyglot architectures where services written in different languages share configuration patterns. A Python service and a Go service can both read REDIS_URL without requiring language-specific configuration libraries or file formats.

Cloud platforms embrace environment variable configuration as the primary mechanism for runtime customization. Container orchestration systems like Kubernetes inject configuration through environment variables, config maps, and secrets. Serverless platforms provide environment variables as the standard configuration interface.

Configuration validation should occur at application startup, failing fast if required variables are missing or contain invalid values. Clear error messages that list missing variables help operators diagnose deployment issues quickly rather than encountering cryptic failures deep in application logic.

Backing services (databases, caches, message queues) should be attachable resources referenced through URLs in configuration.

doc-configuration-003,Network Security Configuration,"Network security configuration controls which clients can access your NovaCLI deployments. Proper configuration prevents unauthorized access while maintaining legitimate connectivity.

IP Allowlisting:

Restrict connections to known IP addresses or ranges:

nova ip-allowlist add <deployment-id> 203.0.113.0/24
nova ip-allowlist add <deployment-id> 198.51.100.42/32

CIDR notation specifies ranges. /32 allows a single IP; /24 allows 256 addresses.

List current allowlist:

nova ip-allowlist list <deployment-id>

Remove entries:

nova ip-allowlist remove <deployment-id> 203.0.113.0/24

Default deny policy: If any allowlist entries exist, all other IPs are blocked.

VPC Peering:

For private network access, establish VPC peering:

nova vpc-peer create 
  --deployment <deployment-id> 
  --vpc-id vpc-abc123 
  --region us-east-1

Deployments become accessible from your VPC without traversing the internet.

Private Endpoints:

Enable private endpoints for internal-only access:

nova settings set deployment.<deployment-id>.network.private_endpoint true

Disables public internet access. Connect only via VPC peering or direct connect.

Firewall Rules:

Configure custom firewall rules:

[firewall]
rule.1.source = ""10.0.0.0/8""
rule.1.protocol = ""tcp""
rule.1.port = 5432
rule.1.action = ""allow""

rule.2.source = ""0.0.0.0/0""
rule.2.action = ""deny""

Rules are evaluated in order. First match determines action.

DDoS Protection:

Enable rate limiting to mitigate denial of service:

[security]
rate_limit_enabled = true
max_connections_per_ip = 100
connection_rate_limit = 10  # connections per second

Aggressive limits may affect legitimate high-volume clients.

Intrusion Detection:

Enable logging of connection attempts:

[logging]
log_connections = true
log_disconnections = true
log_failed_auth = true

Review logs regularly for suspicious patterns:

nova logs search <deployment-id> ""failed authentication""

Network Monitoring:

Monitor network metrics:

nova deploy stats <deployment-id> --metric network

Displays active connections, bytes transferred, connection failures.

Geographic Restrictions:

Restrict access by country (requires enterprise plan):

[geo]
allowed_countries = [""US"", ""CA"", ""MX""]
blocked_countries = [""*""]

Useful for compliance with data residency requirements.

Audit Logging:

Log all configuration changes:

nova audit-log enable --deployment <deployment-id>

doc-configuration-021,Caching Configuration,"NovaCLI v3.1 provides built-in caching mechanisms to reduce latency and improve performance. This guide covers configuring application-level caching, cache invalidation, and distributed caching.

Application Cache:

Enable in-memory application caching:

[cache]
enabled = true
backend = ""memory""  # or ""redis"", ""memcached""
max_size_mb = 512
eviction_policy = ""lru""  # or ""lfu"", ""fifo""

LRU (Least Recently Used) works well for most workloads.

Cache TTL:

Configure time-to-live for cached entries:

[cache.ttl]
default = 300  # seconds
query_results = 60
configuration = 3600
static_content = 86400

Different TTLs for different data types optimize cache hit rate.

Redis Backend:

Use Redis for distributed caching:

[cache.redis]
url = ""redis://cache-cluster:6379/0""
password = ""${REDIS_PASSWORD}""
max_connections = 50
connection_timeout = 5

Cluster mode:

[cache.redis.cluster]
enabled = true
nodes = [""redis1:6379"", ""redis2:6379"", ""redis3:6379""]

Memcached Backend:

Alternative distributed cache:

[cache.memcached]
servers = [""memcached1:11211"", ""memcached2:11211""]
max_connections_per_server = 10

Cache Warming:

Pre-populate cache at startup:

[cache.warming]
enabled = true
keys = [""frequent_query_1"", ""frequent_query_2""]
warm_on_startup = true
warm_on_clear = true

Reduces cold start latency.

Cache Invalidation:

Invalidate cache on changes:

[cache.invalidation]
strategy = ""write-through""  # or ""write-back"", ""write-around""
auto_invalidate_on_update = true

Write-through updates cache and database simultaneously.

Manual invalidation:

nova cache clear <key>
nova cache clear --pattern ""user:*""
nova cache flush  # Clear entire cache

Cache Keys:

Structure cache keys consistently:

[cache.keys]
prefix = ""novacli""
namespace_separator = "":""
version_keys = true

Example key: novacli:v1:user:123:profile

Cache Bypass:

Bypass cache for specific requests:

nova deploy list --no-cache

Configuration:

[cache.bypass]
headers = [""X-No-Cache"", ""Cache-Control: no-cache""]

Cache Monitoring:

Expose cache metrics:

[cache.metrics]
enabled = true
hit_rate = true
miss_rate = true
eviction_count = true
size_bytes = true

View cache statistics:

nova cache stats

Cache Compression:

Compress large cached values:

[cache.compression]
enabled = true
min_size_bytes = 1024
algorithm = ""gzip""  # or ""lz4"", ""zstd""

Trade CPU for memory savings.

Cache Partitioning:

Partition cache by tenant or environment:

[cache.partitions]
tenant_isolation = true
partition_key = ""tenant_id""

Prevents cache pollution across tenants.

Cache Persistence:

Persist cache to disk:

[cache.persistence]
enabled = true
interval = 300  # seconds
path = ""/var/lib/nova/cache""

Survives process restarts.

Read-Through Cache:

Automatic cache population:

[http://cache.read_through]
enabled = true
loader = ""database""  # or ""api"", ""file""

Cache miss triggers data load and cache update.

Cache Stampede Prevention:

Prevent thundering herd:

[cache.stampede]
prevention_enabled = true
lock_timeout = 5  # seconds

Single request regenerates expired entry; others wait.

Multi-Tier Caching:

Combine memory and distributed caches:

[cache.tiers]
l1_cache = ""memory""
l2_cache = ""redis""

doc-troubleshooting-006,Diagnosing SSL Certificate Errors,"SSL certificate errors prevent secure connections between NovaCLI and the Nova API. These errors appear as certificate verification failures and require understanding certificate chains, validity periods, and trust stores.

Common SSL Errors:

Certificate verification errors typically present as:

- ""SSL certificate verify failed: certificate has expired""
- ""SSL certificate verify failed: self signed certificate in certificate chain""
- ""SSL certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate""

Expired Certificates:

If you encounter an expired certificate error, first verify the current date and time on your system. Incorrect system time causes certificate validation failures. Sync your system clock with a time server:

On Linux/macOS: sudo ntpdate http://pool.ntp.org
On Windows: Settings > Time & Language > Set time automatically

If your system time is correct but errors persist, Nova's SSL certificate may be near expiration. Check the certificate expiry date:

openssl s_client -connect http://api.nova.io:443 -servername http://api.nova.io < /dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates

Self-Signed Certificate Errors:

Corporate networks often use SSL inspection, inserting a self-signed corporate certificate in the chain. This is legitimate in corporate environments. Configure NovaCLI to trust your corporate CA:

nova config set http://ssl.ca_bundle /etc/ssl/certs/corporate-ca.pem

Alternatively, obtain the CA certificate from your IT department and add it to your system trust store.

Missing CA Certificates:

""Unable to get local issuer certificate"" indicates missing root CA certificates in your system trust store. This commonly affects minimal Linux installations or containers. Install CA certificates:

Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install ca-certificates
CentOS/RHEL: sudo yum install ca-certificates
Alpine: apk add ca-certificates

Disabling Verification (Not Recommended):

For testing only, you can disable certificate verification:

nova config set ssl.verify false

This is insecure and should never be used in production. Only use for debugging to determine if SSL is the issue.

Proxy SSL Termination:

Proxies performing SSL termination may cause certificate mismatches. Configure proxy SSL settings:

doc-cli_commands-3.1-semantic_bait,Command-Line Interface Design Principles,"Command-line interfaces remain the preferred tool for developers, system administrators, and power users who value speed, scriptability, and precise control. A well-designed CLI can transform complex operations into simple, memorable commands that become second nature to daily users.

Effective CLI design starts with consistency. Users should be able to predict command structure based on patterns they've already learned. Verb-noun ordering, consistent flag naming, and predictable output formats reduce cognitive load and minimize the need to constantly reference documentation.

Command hierarchy matters for discoverability. Flat command structures with dozens of top-level commands overwhelm users and make features hard to find. Group related functionality under logical parent commands, allowing users to explore capabilities through intuitive navigation. A user who knows how to manage deployments should easily guess where to find deployment logs.

Flags and arguments should follow conventions established by widely-used tools. Single-dash short flags (-v) pair with double-dash long flags (--verbose) for the same option. Boolean flags shouldn't require values, while flags that accept input should fail clearly when values are missing. Required arguments appear before optional ones.

Error messages deserve as much attention as success paths. When a command fails, explain what went wrong, why it matters, and what the user can do to fix it. Suggest corrections for typos, explain missing prerequisites, and provide examples of correct usage. Never leave users staring at cryptic error codes.

Output formatting should adapt to context. Interactive sessions benefit from human-readable tables with colors and formatting, while scripts need machine-parsable JSON or CSV. Respect the NO_COLOR environment variable and provide explicit format flags for users who need consistent output.

Backward compatibility prevents breaking changes from disrupting user workflows.

doc-configuration-006,Plugin System Configuration,"NovaCLI v3.1 supports extensibility through a plugin system. Plugins add custom commands, data sources, and integrations without modifying core functionality. This guide covers plugin installation, configuration, and development.

Plugin Installation:

Install plugins from the official registry:

nova plugin install <plugin-name>

Example:

nova plugin install prometheus-exporter

Installs the Prometheus exporter plugin, adding monitoring endpoints to deployments.

List installed plugins:

nova plugin list

Displays plugin name, version, status (enabled/disabled).

Plugin Configuration:

Configure plugins via dedicated configuration sections:

[plugins.prometheus-exporter]
enabled = true
port = 9090
metrics_path = ""/metrics""

[plugins.slack-notifier]
enabled = true
webhook_url = ""${SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL}""
default_channel = ""#deployments""

Plugin-specific settings are documented in plugin README files.

Plugin Discovery:

Browse available plugins:

nova plugin search <keyword>

Search registry by functionality, tags, or author.

View plugin details:

nova plugin info prometheus-exporter

Displays description, version history, configuration options, and dependencies.

Plugin Updates:

Update plugins to latest versions:

nova plugin update <plugin-name>

Update all plugins:

nova plugin update --all

Automatic updates (requires configuration):

[plugins]
auto_update = true
update_check_interval = 86400  # Daily

Plugin Removal:

Uninstall plugins:

nova plugin uninstall <plugin-name>

Removes plugin code and configuration. Existing deployments using plugin features may break.

Custom Plugin Development:

Create custom plugins for organization-specific needs:

nova plugin init my-custom-plugin

Generates plugin scaffold with manifest, entry point, and example commands.

Plugin manifest (plugin.toml):

name = ""my-custom-plugin""
version = ""1.0.0""
author = ""your-name""
description = ""Custom functionality""

[dependencies]
nova_sdk = ""^3.1""

[commands]
my-command = ""http://commands.my_command:main""

Implement plugin commands in Python:

from nova_sdk import Command, Context

def main(ctx: Context):
    http://ctx.logger.info(""Custom command executed"")
    # Plugin logic here

Test plugin locally:

nova plugin install --dev ./my-custom-plugin

Publish to private registry:

nova plugin publish --registry https://plugins.company.com

Plugin Security:

Plugins run with full access to NovaCLI functionality. Only install trusted plugins.

Audit plugin permissions:

nova plugin audit <plugin-name>

Displays requested permissions and potential security concerns.

Sandboxed execution (experimental):

[http://plugins.security]
sandbox_enabled = true
allow_network = false
allow_filesystem = false

doc-configuration-029,Service Mesh Integration,"NovaCLI v3.1 integrates with service mesh platforms for advanced traffic management, observability, and security. This guide covers Istio and Linkerd integration.

Service Mesh Selection:

Choose service mesh platform:

[service_mesh]
enabled = true
provider = ""istio""  # or ""linkerd"", ""consul""
version = ""1.18.0""

Automatic sidecar injection:

[service_mesh.injection]
auto_inject = true
namespaces = [""production"", ""staging""]

Traffic Management:

Configure traffic routing:

[service_mesh.traffic]
load_balancing = ""round_robin""  # or ""least_request"", ""random""
connection_pool_size = 100
timeout_seconds = 30

Traffic splitting:

nova service-mesh route update 
  --deployment <deployment-id> 
  --version v1 --weight 90 
  --version v2 --weight 10

Circuit Breaking:

Configure circuit breakers:

[service_mesh.circuit_breaker]
enabled = true
max_connections = 100
max_pending_requests = 50
max_requests = 100
consecutive_errors = 5

Retry Policy:

Configure retry behavior:

[service_mesh.retry]
enabled = true
attempts = 3
per_try_timeout = 10  # seconds
retry_on = [""5xx"", ""gateway-error"", ""refused-stream""]

Timeout Configuration:

Set request timeouts:

[service_mesh.timeouts]
request_timeout = 30  # seconds
idle_timeout = 300
connection_timeout = 10

Canary Deployments:

Gradual rollout:

nova service-mesh canary start 
  --deployment <deployment-id> 
  --new-version v2 
  --initial-weight 5 
  --increment 10 
  --interval 300

Automatic promotion:

[service_mesh.canary]
auto_promote = true
success_threshold = 0.99
max_error_rate = 0.01

Mutual TLS:

Enforce mTLS:

[service_mesh.mtls]
mode = ""strict""  # or ""permissive"", ""disabled""
auto_rotate_certs = true
cert_lifetime_hours = 24

Observability:

Integrate with observability tools:

[service_mesh.observability]
tracing_enabled = true
tracing_sample_rate = 0.1
metrics_enabled = true
metrics_port = 15090

Distributed Tracing:

Configure tracing backend:

[service_mesh.tracing]
backend = ""jaeger""  # or ""zipkin"", ""datadog""
endpoint = ""http://jaeger-collector:14268""

Traffic Policies:

Define traffic policies:

[service_mesh.policies]

[[service_mesh.policies.policy]]
name = ""rate-limit""
target = ""api-service""
requests_per_minute = 1000

[[service_mesh.policies.policy]]
name = ""auth-required""
target = ""admin-service""
require_jwt = true

Fault Injection:

Test resilience:

nova service-mesh fault inject 
  --deployment <deployment-id> 
  --delay 5s 
  --percentage 10

Or inject errors:

nova service-mesh fault inject 
  --deployment <deployment-id> 
  --abort-http 503 
  --percentage 5

Egress Control:

Control outbound traffic:

[service_mesh.egress]
default_policy = ""deny""  # or ""allow""
allowed_hosts = [""http://api.external.com"", ""*.http://trusted-partner.com""]

Service Discovery:

Automatic service discovery:

[service_mesh.discovery]
enabled = true
dns_resolution = true
health_checks = true

Telemetry:

Collect mesh telemetry:

[service_mesh.telemetry]
collect_metrics = true
collect_logs = true
collect_traces = true
export_to = [""prometheus"", ""elasticsearch""]

Security Policies:

Define authorization policies:

[service_http://mesh.security]

[[service_http://mesh.security.policy]]
name = ""api-access""
source_principals = [""cluster.local/ns/frontend/sa/frontend""]

doc-troubleshooting-012,Command Execution Timeout Errors,"NovaCLI command timeouts occur when operations exceed configured time limits. Understanding timeout types and adjustment strategies helps complete long-running operations successfully.

Types of Timeouts:

NovaCLI uses several timeout categories:

- Connection timeout: Time to establish TCP connection (default: 30s)
- Read timeout: Time to receive response after sending request (default: 60s)
- Command timeout: Maximum execution time for specific commands (varies by command)

Increasing Connection Timeout:

For slow networks, increase connection timeout:

nova config set network.connect_timeout 90

This allows 90 seconds to establish connections instead of the default 30.

Adjusting Read Timeout:

Long-running API operations may exceed read timeout. Increase globally:

nova config set http://network.read_timeout 300

Or for specific commands:

nova deploy create --timeout 600 [other options]

This allows 10 minutes for the deployment creation to complete.

Command-Specific Timeouts:

Some commands accept timeout parameters:

- nova backup restore: --timeout seconds
- nova deploy upgrade: --timeout seconds
- nova logs export: --timeout seconds

Use command help to check available options:

nova backup restore --help

Network Latency:

High network latency contributes to timeouts. Test latency to Nova API:

ping -c 10 http://api.nova.io

Latency above 200ms may require increased timeouts. Consider using a region closer to your location for better performance.

Proxy Timeouts:

Corporate proxies may enforce their own timeouts. Configure proxy timeout:

nova config set proxy.timeout 300

Coordinate with network administrators to increase proxy timeout limits if needed.

Retry with Backoff:

For operations that timeout inconsistently, implement retry logic:

nova deploy create --retry 3 --retry-delay 60 [other options]

This retries failed operations up to 3 times with 60-second delays.

Background Operations:

For extremely long operations, use asynchronous mode if available:

nova backup create deployment-id --async

doc-configuration-011,Container Runtime Configuration,"NovaCLI v3.1 deployments run in containerized environments. This guide covers container-specific configuration options for resource allocation, image management, and runtime behavior.

Container Image Selection:

Choose base container image:

[container]
base_image = ""novacli/runtime:3.1-alpine""
image_pull_policy = ""IfNotPresent""

Available base images:
- novacli/runtime:3.1-alpine (lightweight, 150MB)
- novacli/runtime:3.1-ubuntu (full-featured, 450MB)
- novacli/runtime:3.1-distroless (minimal attack surface, 80MB)

Pull policies: Always, IfNotPresent, Never.

Private Registry Authentication:

Authenticate with private container registries:

[container.registry]
url = ""http://registry.company.com""
username = ""${REGISTRY_USERNAME}""
password = ""${REGISTRY_PASSWORD}""

Supports Docker Hub, ECR, GCR, ACR, and self-hosted registries.

Resource Requests and Limits:

Kubernetes-style resource configuration:

[container.resources]
requests.cpu = ""1000m""
requests.memory = ""2Gi""
limits.cpu = ""2000m""
limits.memory = ""4Gi""

Requests guarantee minimum allocation. Limits prevent overconsumption.

Volume Mounts:

Mount persistent storage:

[container.volumes]
data.mount_path = ""/var/lib/nova""
data.size_gb = 100
http://data.storage_class = ""ssd""

config.mount_path = ""/etc/nova""
http://config.read_only = true

Separate volumes for data and configuration improve security.

Environment Configuration:

Inject environment variables:

[container.env]
NOVA_ENV = ""production""
LOG_LEVEL = ""info""
DATABASE_URL = ""${DATABASE_URL}""

Supports variable substitution from secrets.

Healthcheck Configuration:

Container health monitoring:

[container.healthcheck]
command = ""nova health check""
interval = 30
timeout = 5
retries = 3
start_period = 60

Unhealthy containers restart automatically.

Security Context:

Container security settings:

[http://container.security]
run_as_user = 1000
run_as_group = 1000
read_only_root_filesystem = true
allow_privilege_escalation = false

Follows principle of least privilege.

Network Mode:

Configure container networking:

[http://container.network]
mode = ""bridge""  # or ""host"", ""none""
ports = [""5432:5432"", ""8080:8080""]

Host mode improves performance but reduces isolation.

Logging Drivers:

Configure log collection:

[container.logging]
driver = ""json-file""
options.max_size = ""10m""
options.max_file = ""3""

Supported drivers: json-file, syslog, journald, gelf, fluentd.

Init Containers:

Run initialization tasks:

[container.init]
image = ""busybox:latest""
command = [""sh"", ""-c"", ""echo initializing && sleep 5""]

Init containers complete before main container starts.

Sidecar Containers:

Deploy auxiliary containers:

[container.sidecars.monitoring]
image = ""prometheus/node-exporter:latest""
ports = [""9100:9100""]

Sidecars share network namespace with main container.

Graceful Shutdown:

Configure termination behavior:

[container.lifecycle]
termination_grace_period = 30

doc-troubleshooting-010,Fixing Network Connectivity Issues,"Network connectivity problems prevent NovaCLI from communicating with the Nova API. Systematic diagnosis helps identify whether issues stem from client configuration, network infrastructure, or service availability.

Basic Connectivity Tests:

Start with fundamental network tests:

ping -c 4 http://api.nova.io
curl -I https://api.nova.io/health

If ping fails, you have network routing or DNS issues. If curl fails but ping succeeds, you have application-layer problems.

DNS Resolution:

DNS failures prevent hostname resolution. Test DNS:

nslookup http://api.nova.io
dig http://api.nova.io

If resolution fails, your DNS server cannot reach Nova's nameservers. Try alternative DNS:

- Google Public DNS: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4
- Cloudflare DNS: 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1
- Quad9 DNS: 9.9.9.9

Configure alternative DNS in your system network settings.

Firewall Blocking:

Corporate and personal firewalls may block outbound HTTPS. Test firewall rules:

telnet http://api.nova.io 443

If connection refused or timeout, firewall rules are blocking port 443. Request firewall exception for:

- Destination: http://api.nova.io
- Protocol: HTTPS
- Port: 443
- Direction: Outbound

Proxy Configuration:

If your network requires a proxy, configure NovaCLI:

nova config set proxy.enabled true
nova config set proxy.url http://proxy.company.com:8080
nova config set proxy.username your-username

Test proxy connectivity:

curl -x http://proxy.company.com:8080 https://api.nova.io/health

VPN Interference:

VPN software sometimes interferes with network routing. If connectivity fails only while VPN is active:

1. Check VPN split tunneling configuration
2. Add http://api.nova.io to VPN bypass list
3. Verify VPN DNS doesn't block Nova domains

IPv6 Issues:

IPv6 connectivity problems can cause timeouts. Force IPv4:

nova config set network.ip_version 4

MTU Problems:

Incorrect MTU settings cause packet fragmentation and connection issues. Test with smaller packets:

ping -c 4 -s 1400 http://api.nova.io

If smaller packets succeed but normal packets fail, adjust MTU:

Linux: sudo ip link set dev eth0 mtu 1400
macOS: sudo ifconfig en0 mtu 1400

Route Tracing:

Trace the network path to Nova:

doc-troubleshooting-019,Diagnosing Import and Export Failures,"Data import and export operations occasionally fail due to format issues, resource constraints, or permissions. Understanding failure modes helps complete data transfer operations successfully.

Import Failures:

Common import errors include:

- ""Parse error at line 1234: invalid CSV format""
- ""Schema mismatch: column 'name' not found in target table""
- ""Import timeout: operation exceeded 3600 seconds""
- ""Insufficient disk space for import""

Format Validation:

Validate file format before importing:

nova import validate --file data.csv --format csv

This checks for format errors, encoding issues, and schema compatibility.

Encoding Issues:

Incorrect character encoding causes parse errors. Specify encoding explicitly:

nova import deployment-id --file data.csv --encoding utf-8

Common encodings: utf-8, latin1, iso-8859-1

Schema Mapping:

Map source columns to target table columns:

nova import deployment-id --file data.csv --table target_table --mapping ""source_col:target_col,name:customer_name""

Large File Imports:

Importing large files may timeout. Split into smaller chunks:

split -l 100000 large_file.csv chunk_

Import each chunk separately:

for chunk in chunk_; do nova import deployment-id --file $chunk; done

Export Failures:

Common export errors:

- ""Export timeout: query execution exceeded limit""
- ""Memory exhausted during export""
- ""Permission denied: cannot write to output file""

Export Optimization:

For large exports, use streaming mode:

nova export deployment-id --query ""SELECT  FROM large_table"" --format csv --stream > output.csv

Streaming writes data incrementally, avoiding memory exhaustion.

Partial Exports:

Export in time-based partitions to reduce size:

nova export deployment-id --query ""SELECT  FROM logs WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2024-09-01' AND '2024-09-07'"" > week1.csv

Compression:

Compress exports to reduce file size and transfer time:

nova export deployment-id --query ""SELECT  FROM data"" --format csv --compress gzip > data.csv.gz

Permissions:

Ensure write permissions for export destination:

doc-configuration-008,Resource Limits and Quotas,"NovaCLI v3.1 enforces resource limits to prevent runaway processes and ensure fair resource allocation. This guide covers configuring limits for CPU, memory, storage, and connections.

CPU Limits:

Restrict CPU usage:

[resources.cpu]
limit_cores = 4.0
request_cores = 2.0
throttle_threshold = 0.95

Limit_cores sets maximum CPU. Request_cores guarantees minimum allocation. Throttle_threshold triggers warnings.

Memory Limits:

Configure memory constraints:

[resources.memory]
limit_gb = 16
request_gb = 8
oom_kill_threshold = 0.98

Exceeding limit triggers OOM killer. Set limit 20-30% above expected usage.

Storage Quotas:

Limit storage consumption:

[http://resources.storage]
data_limit_gb = 500
backup_limit_gb = 100
temp_limit_gb = 50

Separate limits for data, backups, and temporary files prevent storage exhaustion.

Connection Limits:

Restrict concurrent connections:

[resources.connections]
max_total = 200
max_per_user = 50
max_per_ip = 100

Prevents connection pool exhaustion from misbehaving clients.

Query Limits:

Timeout long-running queries:

[resources.queries]
statement_timeout = 300000      # milliseconds
lock_timeout = 10000
idle_in_transaction_timeout = 60000

Statement timeout aborts queries exceeding duration. Idle_in_transaction prevents leaked transactions.

Rate Limits:

Limit request rates:

[resources.rate_limits]
requests_per_second = 100
burst_size = 200

Burst_size allows temporary spikes above sustained rate.

User Quotas:

Per-user resource allocation:

[quotas]
enabled = true
default_quota_gb = 100
max_quota_gb = 1000

Assign quotas to individual users:

nova user quota set <username> --storage 500 --connections 50

Quota Enforcement:

Behavior when exceeding limits:

[quotas.enforcement]
mode = ""soft""  # or ""hard""
warning_threshold = 0.80
grace_period_hours = 24

Soft limits send warnings but allow continued operation. Hard limits block requests immediately.

Monitoring Resource Usage:

View current consumption:

nova deploy resources <deployment-id>

Displays CPU, memory, storage, connections as percentage of limits.

Alerts on threshold violations:

nova alerts create 
  --type resource-limit 
  --deployment <deployment-id> 
  --threshold 0.90

Notifies when usage exceeds 90% of limit.

Automatic Scaling:

Scale resources based on usage:

[autoscaling]
enabled = true
scale_up_threshold = 0.80
scale_down_threshold = 0.30
min_resources = ""small""
max_resources = ""large""

Automatically adjusts deployment size within configured range.

ResourceTerritory Management:

Allocate resources across multiple deployments:

[resource_pools]
pool.production.cpu = 100
pool.production.memory_gb = 256
pool.development.cpu = 20
pool.development.memory_gb = 64

doc-troubleshooting-024,Handling Region and Availability Zone Issues,"Regional deployment issues affect performance, availability, and compliance. Understanding region selection and troubleshooting location-specific problems ensures optimal deployment configuration.

Available Regions:

List supported regions:

nova regions list

This shows region names, locations, availability status, and supported features.

Region Selection Criteria:

Choose regions based on:

- Data residency requirements (GDPR, SOC2, etc.)
- Latency to primary users
- Redundancy and failover needs
- Cost (regions have different pricing)
- Feature availability (some features are region-specific)

Region Unavailability:

Errors like ""Region us-west is unavailable"" indicate:

- Temporary capacity constraints
- Scheduled maintenance in that region
- Region deprecation

Check region status:

nova regions status us-west

Choose an alternative region if extended unavailability is expected.

Cross-Region Latency:

High latency between application and deployment regions impacts performance. Measure latency:

ping -c 10 deployment-hostname

If latency exceeds 100ms, consider moving closer to your primary user base.

Migrating Between Regions:

Move deployments to different regions:

1. Create backup of source deployment
2. Create new deployment in target region
3. Restore backup to new deployment
4. Update application connection strings
5. Verify functionality
6. Delete old deployment

Full migration procedure:

nova backup create deployment-id
nova deploy create --region us-east --name new-deployment
nova backup restore backup-id --target new-deployment-id

Data Residency Compliance:

Ensure deployments reside in compliant regions:

nova deploy get deployment-id --format json | jq '.region'

For EU GDPR compliance, use eu-west or eu-central regions.

Availability Zone Failures:

Multi-AZ deployments provide redundancy. Monitor AZ health:

nova deploy availability deployment-id

During AZ failures, deployments automatically failover to healthy zones.

Cross-Region Replication:

Create read replicas in different regions for disaster recovery:

doc-configuration-019,Custom Metrics and Instrumentation,"NovaCLI v3.1 allows defining custom metrics and instrumentation points to monitor application-specific behavior. This guide covers creating, exposing, and visualizing custom metrics.

Defining Custom Metrics:

Register custom metrics in configuration:

[custom_metrics]
enabled = true

[custom_metrics.counters]
business_transactions = {help = ""Total business transactions processed"", labels = [""type"", ""status""]}
api_calls_total = {help = ""Total API calls"", labels = [""endpoint"", ""method""]}

[custom_metrics.gauges]
active_users = {help = ""Currently active users""}
queue_depth = {help = ""Items in processing queue"", labels = [""queue_name""]}

[custom_metrics.histograms]
request_duration = {help = ""Request duration in seconds"", buckets = [0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0]}

Counter Instrumentation:

Increment counters via CLI:

nova metrics increment business_transactions --labels type=purchase,status=success

Or via API:

curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/metrics/increment 
  -d 'metric=api_calls_total&endpoint=/users&method=GET'

Gauge Updates:

Set gauge values:

nova metrics set active_users 42
nova metrics set queue_depth 150 --labels queue_name=processing

Gauges reflect current state, not cumulative counts.

Histogram Recording:

Record histogram observations:

nova metrics observe request_duration 0.234

Histograms calculate percentiles automatically.

Metric Labels:

Use labels for dimensionality:

[custom_metrics.counters]
errors_total = {
  help = ""Total errors"",
  labels = [""error_type"", ""severity"", ""component""]
}

Avoid high-cardinality labels (user IDs, timestamps).

Metric Export:

Export metrics in multiple formats:

[custom_metrics.export]
prometheus = true
graphite = true
json = true

Prometheus format (default):

curl http://localhost:9090/metrics

JSON format:

curl http://localhost:9090/metrics/json

Metric Aggregation:

Aggregate across instances:

[custom_metrics.aggregation]
mode = ""sum""  # or ""average"", ""min"", ""max""
aggregation_window = 60  # seconds

Useful in multi-instance deployments.

Alerts on Custom Metrics:

Define metric-based alerts:

[custom_metrics.alerts]

[[custom_metrics.alerts.rules]]
metric = ""queue_depth""
condition = "">""
threshold = 1000
duration = 300  # seconds
severity = ""warning""
channels = [""slack"", ""email""]

[[custom_metrics.alerts.rules]]
metric = ""errors_total""
condition = ""increase_rate""
threshold = 10  # per minute
duration = 60
severity = ""critical""

Visualization:

Generate metric dashboards:

nova metrics dashboard create 
  --title ""Business Metrics"" 
  --metrics business_transactions,active_users,request_duration

Export Grafana dashboard:

nova metrics dashboard export --format grafana --output dashboard.json

Metric Retention:

Configure local metric retention:

[custom_metrics.retention]
local_buffer_size = 10000
retention_period = 3600  # seconds

Older metrics discarded to limit memory.

Sampling:

Reduce overhead via sampling:

[custom_metrics.sampling]
enabled = true
rate = 0.1  # Sample 10% of events

Trade accuracy for performance.

Custom Metric Plugins:

Extend with plugins:

[custom_metrics.plugins]
custom_exporter = ""plugins/custom_http://exporter.py""

Plugin receives metrics and can export to custom destinations.

Performance Impact:

Metric overhead:
- Counters: ~100ns per increment
- Gauges: ~50ns per set
- Histograms: ~500ns per observation

Negligible for most applications.

Best Practices:

- Use descriptive metric names
- Include units in help text (seconds, bytes, etc.)
- Avoid metrics for PII
- Keep label cardinality under 1000

doc-troubleshooting-002,Debugging Authentication Failures,"Authentication failures in NovaCLI prevent access to all API operations. Understanding the different authentication error types helps diagnose and resolve these issues quickly.

Error: Unauthorized (401):

This indicates invalid or missing credentials. First, verify your authentication status:

nova auth status

If you see ""Not authenticated,"" log in again:

nova auth login

If login succeeds but subsequent commands fail, your token may have been revoked. This happens when you reset your password, enable two-factor authentication, or manually revoke tokens through the web dashboard.

Token Expiration:

API tokens expire after 90 days of inactivity. If you haven't used NovaCLI in several months, your token may be expired. Re-authenticate to obtain a fresh token.

Error: Forbidden (403):

This indicates valid authentication but insufficient permissions. Your account role may not have access to the requested resource. Check your account permissions in the Nova dashboard under Settings > Account > Permissions.

Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts certain operations to specific roles:

- Viewer: Read-only access, cannot create or modify deployments
- Developer: Full access to deployments, limited billing access
- Admin: Full access to all resources including billing and user management

Multi-Account Configuration:

If you manage multiple Nova accounts, ensure you're authenticated with the correct account:

nova auth list

This displays all configured accounts. Switch accounts with:

nova auth switch account-name

Credential Storage Issues:

NovaCLI stores credentials in your system keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or Linux Secret Service). If keychain access fails, you'll see ""Failed to retrieve credentials from keychain."" This can occur after OS updates or keychain corruption.

Fix keychain issues by removing and re-adding credentials:

nova auth logout
nova auth login

Environment Variable Override:

The NOVA_API_TOKEN environment variable overrides stored credentials. If set incorrectly, all commands will fail with authentication errors. Check for this variable:

doc-changelog-001,Release Notes: NovaCLI v3.1.0,"NovaCLI v3.1.0 is now available, featuring enhanced authentication methods, improved performance, and expanded platform support. This release focuses on security improvements and developer experience enhancements.

New Features:

Multi-Factor Authentication Support:

NovaCLI now integrates with TOTP-based multi-factor authentication. Enable MFA for enhanced account security:

nova auth enable-mfa

This generates a QR code for your authenticator app. Subsequent logins require both password and MFA token.

Enhanced Deployment Monitoring:

New real-time metrics dashboard provides comprehensive visibility into deployment health:

- CPU, memory, disk, and network metrics
- Query performance statistics
- Connection pool utilization
- Slow query identification

Access via: nova deploy dashboard deployment-id

Automated Backup Verification:

Backups are now automatically verified after creation, ensuring recoverability. Verification includes:

- Checksum validation
- Restore simulation
- Schema integrity checks

Failed verifications trigger immediate alerts.

Webhook Event Filtering:

Webhooks support fine-grained event filtering, reducing noise:

nova webhook create --events ""deployment.status_changed[running->stopped],alert.triggered[severity=critical]""

Improvements:

- Deployment creation time reduced by 40% through optimized provisioning
- Log query performance improved with new indexing strategy
- CLI startup time reduced by 60% with lazy loading
- Better error messages with actionable troubleshooting steps

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed connection pool leak affecting long-running deployments
- Resolved timezone handling issues in log filtering
- Corrected backup restore failures for cross-region operations
- Fixed CLI crash when config file contains UTF-8 BOM

Breaking Changes:

None. This release maintains full backward compatibility with v3.0.

Upgrade Instructions:

Upgrade CLI: nova self-update

doc-configuration-023,Deployment Templates,"NovaCLI v3.1 supports deployment templates to standardize and accelerate deployment creation. This guide covers creating, managing, and using templates.

Template Structure:

Templates are TOML files with predefined configurations:

# production-template.toml
name = ""Production Deployment""
description = ""Standard production configuration""

[deployment]
size = ""large""
region = ""us-east-1""
high_availability = true

[database]
max_connections = 100
backup_enabled = true
backup_retention_days = 30

[security]
ssl_required = true
ip_allowlist = [""${OFFICE_IP}""]

[monitoring]
metrics_enabled = true
alerts_enabled = true

Built-in Templates:

NovaCLI includes standard templates:

- development: Small, minimal features
- staging: Medium, mirrors production
- production: Large, full features
- high-availability: Multi-region, HA
- minimal: Smallest possible deployment

List templates:

nova template list

View template:

nova template show production

Creating Templates:

Create custom template:

nova template create 
  --name microservice 
  --file microservice-template.toml

Template inheritance:

# custom-template.toml
extends = ""production""

[deployment]
size = ""xlarge""  # Override parent

[custom]
custom_setting = ""value""

Using Templates:

Create deployment from template:

nova deploy create --template production --name my-deployment

Override template values:

nova deploy create 
  --template production 
  --name my-deployment 
  --set deployment.size=xlarge 
  --set database.max_connections=200

Template Variables:

Use variables in templates:

# template.toml
[deployment]
name = ""${DEPLOYMENT_NAME}""
region = ""${AWS_REGION:-us-east-1}""  # Default value

Provide variables:

nova deploy create 
  --template custom 
  --var DEPLOYMENT_NAME=my-app 
  --var AWS_REGION=eu-west-1

Template Validation:

Validate template syntax:

nova template validate custom-template.toml

Strict validation:

nova template validate custom-template.toml --strict

Template Versioning:

Version templates for compatibility:

# template.toml
version = ""2.0.0""
min_cli_version = ""3.1.0""

Export Deployment as Template:

Create template from existing deployment:

nova deploy export <deployment-id> --output template.toml

Removes instance-specific values, keeps configuration.

Template Repositories:

Share templates via repositories:

[templates.repository]
url = ""https://templates.company.com/novacli""
authentication = ""token""
token = ""${TEMPLATE_REPO_TOKEN}""

Install from repository:

nova template install company/production-template

Template Parameters:

Define configurable parameters:

# template.toml
[parameters]

[[parameters.param]]
name = ""deployment_size""
type = ""string""
allowed_values = [""small"", ""medium"", ""large""]
default = ""medium""
description = ""Deployment size""

[[parameters.param]]
name = ""enable_backup""
type = ""boolean""
default = true

Prompt for parameters:

nova deploy create --template interactive

Template Testing:

Test template without creating deployment:

nova template test production-template.toml

Dry-run with template:

nova deploy create --template production --dry-run

Template Documentation:

Embed documentation in templates:

# template.toml
[metadata]
name = ""Production Template""
author = ""DevOps Team""
documentation = ""https://docs.company.com/templates/production""
examples = [
  ""nova deploy create --template production --name prod-app""
]

Template Linting:

Check template quality:

nova template lint custom-template.toml

Reports best practice violations.

Template Catalog:

Browse public templates:

nova template catalog

doc-getting-started-001,Installing NovaCLI on Linux,"NovaCLI v3.1 provides native packages for all major Linux distributions, simplifying installation and updates through your system's package manager. This guide covers installation on Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Fedora, and Arch Linux.

For Ubuntu and Debian systems, add the official NovaCLI repository to your package sources. First, import the GPG key to verify package authenticity:

curl -fsSL https://packages.nova.io/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nova-archive-keyring.gpg

Add the repository to your sources list:

echo ""deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nova-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.nova.io/apt stable main"" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nova.list

Update your package index and install NovaCLI:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install novacli

For CentOS and Fedora systems, add the NovaCLI repository:

sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://packages.nova.io/rpm/nova.repo

Install using DNF or YUM:

sudo dnf install novacli

Arch Linux users can install from the AUR:

yay -S novacli

After installation, verify the version:

nova --version

You should see output indicating NovaCLI v3.1.x. The installation includes the nova binary, shell completion scripts for Bash, Zsh, and Fish, and default configuration templates.

Complete the initial setup by authenticating with your Nova account:

nova auth login

doc-api-reference-014,API Versioning and Deprecation Policy,"The NovaCLI API follows semantic versioning with a clear deprecation policy to ensure stability while enabling evolution. This reference covers version management, migration strategies, and deprecation timelines.

API Version Format:

Version in URL path:

https://api.novacli.io/v1/deployments
https://api.novacli.io/v2/deployments

Major versions only in URL. Minor and patch versions transparent to clients.

Current API version: v1
Latest stable: v1.5.2

Version Detection:

Response headers include version:

X-API-Version: 1.5.2
X-API-Min-Version: 1.0.0

Versioning Philosophy:

Major version (v1 → v2):
- Breaking changes to existing endpoints
- Removed fields or endpoints
- Changed data types
- Altered authentication methods
- Requires client code changes

Minor version (v1.5 → v1.6):
- New endpoints or features
- New optional parameters
- New response fields
- Backward compatible
- No client changes required

Patch version (v1.5.2 → v1.5.3):
- Bug fixes
- Documentation updates
- Performance improvements
- Fully backward compatible

Deprecation Process:

Deprecation timeline:

1. Announcement: 6 months before deprecation
2. Warning phase: Deprecated header added
3. Sunset date: Feature removal date set
4. Grace period: 3 months with warnings
5. Removal: Feature no longer available

Minimum support: 12 months notice for major versions

Deprecation Headers:

Deprecated endpoints return:

Deprecation: true
Sunset: Wed, 31 Dec 2025 23:59:59 GMT
Link: <https://docs.novacli.io/migrations/v1-to-v2>; rel=""deprecation""

Example response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Deprecation: true
Sunset: Wed, 31 Dec 2025 23:59:59 GMT
X-API-Version: 1.5.2

Deprecated Field Handling:

Deprecated fields:
- Remain in responses during transition
- Accept input but ignored
- Documentation marked as deprecated
- Alternative provided

Example deprecation notice:

{
  ""data"": {
    ""deployment_id"": ""dep-abc123"",  // Deprecated: Use 'id' instead
    ""id"": ""dep-abc123""
  }
}

Client Version Negotiation:

Request specific version:

Accept: application/vnd.novacli.v1+json

Alternative: Query parameter:

GET /deployments?api_version=1

Version Compatibility Matrix:

API v1 compatibility:
- CLI v3.0+: Full support
- CLI v2.5-2.9: Partial support
- CLI v2.0-2.4: Deprecated
- CLI v1.x: Unsupported

Migration Guides:

Version migration documentation:

v0 → v1: https://docs.novacli.io/migrations/v0-to-v1
v1 → v2 (planned): https://docs.novacli.io/migrations/v1-to-v2

Each guide includes:
- Breaking changes summary
- Code migration examples
- Automated migration tools
- Testing strategies
- Rollback procedures

Breaking Change Examples:

v1 breaking changes from v0:

1. Authentication: API keys replace username/password
2. Date format: ISO 8601 replaces Unix timestamps
3. Error format: Standardized error structure
4. Pagination: Cursor-based added, offset deprecated
5. Field naming: snake_case replaces camelCase

Automatic Migration Support:

NovaCLI provides migration tools:

nova api migrate --from v0 --to v1 --input requests.json

Outputs converted API calls.

Version Support Lifecycle:

Typical major version timeline:

- Year 1: Current version, full support
- Year 2: Maintained, security updates only
- Year 3: Deprecated, warnings added
- Year 3.5: Sunset announced
- Year 4: Removed

v1 timeline:
- 2023-06: Released
- 2024-06: v2 announced
- 2025-06: v1 deprecated
- 2025-12: v1 sunset date
- 2026-01: v1 removed

Beta Features:

New features may launch as beta:

X-API-Feature: beta
X-API-Feature-Name: advanced-filtering

Beta features:
- May change without notice
- Not covered by versioning guarantees
- Opt-in via header or parameter
- Promoted to stable in minor version

Monitoring Deprecations:

Track deprecated API usage:

GET /account/api-usage

Returns:

doc-getting-started-002,Installing NovaCLI on macOS,"NovaCLI v3.1 supports macOS 11 Big Sur and later on both Intel and Apple Silicon processors. Installation is straightforward using Homebrew, the recommended package manager for macOS.

If you don't have Homebrew installed, install it first by visiting http://brew.sh or running:

/bin/bash -c ""$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)""

Once Homebrew is available, install NovaCLI by adding the official tap:

brew tap nova/cli
brew install novacli

Homebrew automatically handles dependency installation, binary placement, and shell completion setup. The nova command becomes immediately available in new terminal sessions.

Verify the installation:

nova --version

You should see NovaCLI v3.1.x displayed. The Homebrew installation includes automatic update notifications when new versions are released.

For users who prefer not to use Homebrew, download the native macOS installer package (DMG) from the NovaCLI website. Mount the disk image and run the installer, which places the binary in /usr/local/bin and installs shell completions.

Apple Silicon users should note that NovaCLI v3.1 includes native ARM64 binaries for optimal performance. Intel Mac users receive x86_64 binaries. Rosetta 2 translation is not required.

After installation, authenticate with your Nova account:

nova auth login

This opens your default browser for secure OAuth authentication. Once authenticated, your credentials are stored in the macOS Keychain for secure access.

To enable shell completion in your current session:

For Zsh (default on macOS):
echo 'eval ""$(nova completion zsh)""' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

For Bash:

doc-migration-001,Migrating from v3.0 to v3.1,"NovaCLI v3.1 maintains backward compatibility with v3.0, making migration straightforward. This guide walks through the upgrade process and highlights new capabilities available after migration.

Pre-Migration Checklist:

Before upgrading:
1. Review release notes for v3.1 feature additions
2. Verify current version: nova --version
3. Create backup of critical deployments
4. Test upgrade in non-production environment first
5. Schedule upgrade during low-traffic period

Upgrading the CLI:

Update the CLI tool:

nova self-update

Verify upgrade:

nova --version
# Should display: NovaCLI v3.1.x

The CLI upgrade is instant with no downtime.

Upgrading Deployments:

Upgrade deployments one at a time or in batches:

Single deployment:
nova deploy upgrade deployment-id --version 3.1

Batch upgrade by tag:
nova deploy upgrade --tag environment=staging --version 3.1

Deployment upgrades use rolling updates with zero downtime. Typical upgrade time: 2-5 minutes.

Configuration Changes:

No configuration changes required. v3.1 uses the same TOML configuration format as v3.0. Existing configuration files work without modification.

New Features Available After Migration:

Multi-Factor Authentication:

Enable MFA for enhanced security:
nova auth enable-mfa

Enhanced Monitoring Dashboard:

Access real-time metrics:
nova deploy dashboard deployment-id

Automated Backup Verification:

Backups are automatically verified after creation. No configuration needed.

Webhook Event Filtering:

Create filtered webhooks:
nova webhook create --events ""deployment.status_changed[running->stopped]""

Verifying Migration Success:

After upgrade, verify deployment health:

nova deploy health deployment-id

Check for warnings or issues introduced by upgrade.

Rollback Procedure:

If issues occur, rollback to v3.0:

nova deploy rollback deployment-id --target-version 3.0

Rollback completes within 2-5 minutes.

Common Issues:

Issue: Upgrade times out
Solution: Increase timeout: nova deploy upgrade deployment-id --version 3.1 --timeout 600

Issue: Health check fails after upgrade
Solution: Wait 5 minutes for deployment stabilization. If issue persists, rollback.

Post-Migration Tasks:

After successful migration:
1. Enable new v3.1 features
2. Update documentation references
3. Train team on new capabilities

doc-troubleshooting-014,Debugging Slow Query Performance,"Slow queries degrade deployment performance and user experience. NovaCLI v3.1 provides comprehensive tools for identifying, analyzing, and optimizing problematic queries.

Enabling Slow Query Logging:

Capture queries exceeding a threshold:

nova deploy update deployment-id --slow-query-log --slow-query-threshold 1000

This logs queries taking longer than 1 second.

Viewing Slow Queries:

Retrieve slow query logs:

nova deploy slow-queries deployment-id --limit 20

This shows the 20 slowest queries with execution time, frequency, and resource consumption.

Query Analysis:

Analyze execution plans for problematic queries:

nova deploy explain deployment-id --query ""SELECT  FROM large_table WHERE unindexed_column = 'value'""

The explain output shows whether the query uses indexes, performs full table scans, or requires sorting.

Missing Indexes:

Full table scans indicate missing indexes. The output typically shows:

- Seq Scan: Full table scan (slow)
- Index Scan: Uses index (fast)
- Bitmap Index Scan: Combines multiple indexes

Create indexes for frequently filtered columns:

nova deploy create-index deployment-id --table large_table --column unindexed_column

Query Rewriting:

Sometimes queries can be rewritten for better performance:

- Replace SELECT  with specific columns
- Use EXISTS instead of COUNT for existence checks
- Avoid functions on indexed columns in WHERE clauses
- Use LIMIT to reduce result set size

Connection Pooling:

Query performance suffers when connection pool is exhausted. Monitor pool usage:

nova deploy connections deployment-id --pool-stats

Increase pool size if frequently exhausted:

nova deploy update deployment-id --connection-pool-size 100

Vacuum and Analyze:

Outdated statistics cause poor query planning. Update statistics:

nova deploy analyze deployment-id

For severely bloated tables, vacuum:

nova deploy vacuum deployment-id --analyze

Resource Constraints:

Slow queries may indicate insufficient resources. Check memory and CPU during query execution:

nova deploy stats deployment-id --detailed --during-query

If memory or CPU is saturated, resize deployment or optimize queries.

Query Caching:

Cache frequently executed queries:

doc-getting-started-003,Installing NovaCLI on Windows,"NovaCLI v3.1 provides native Windows support with installers for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Choose between the graphical installer or command-line installation via package managers.

For most users, the MSI installer provides the simplest experience. Download the latest installer from the NovaCLI website and run the executable. The installer wizard guides you through setup, including:

- License agreement acceptance
- Installation directory selection (default: C:Program FilesNovaCLI)
- PATH environment variable configuration
- Shell completion installation for PowerShell
- Desktop shortcut creation

After installation, open a new PowerShell or Command Prompt window and verify:

nova --version

Alternatively, use Windows Package Manager (winget) for command-line installation:

winget install Nova.CLI

Or use Chocolatey:

choco install novacli

Both package managers handle updates and uninstallation through their respective interfaces.

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) users can install the Linux version of NovaCLI within their WSL distribution for a native Linux experience. Follow the Linux installation instructions from within your WSL terminal.

PowerShell users benefit from tab completion and command history. Enable PowerShell completions by adding to your profile:

nova completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression

To make this permanent, add the line to your PowerShell profile:

notepad $PROFILE

Authentication on Windows uses the Windows Credential Manager for secure storage:

nova auth login

Your credentials are encrypted and stored using Windows Data Protection API, ensuring they're accessible only to your user account.

doc-troubleshooting-022,Resolving API Token Errors,"API token issues prevent programmatic access to Nova deployments. Understanding token lifecycle and troubleshooting authentication helps restore API access in NovaCLI v3.1.

Token Types:

Nova supports several token types:

- User tokens: tied to user accounts, inherit user permissions
- Service tokens: for application integration, scoped permissions
- Temporary tokens: short-lived for restricted operations

Token Expiration:

Tokens expire based on type:

- User tokens: 90 days of inactivity
- Service tokens: 1 year from creation
- Temporary tokens: configurable, typically 1-24 hours

Check token expiration:

nova auth token-info token-id

This displays creation date, expiration date, and scope.

Generating New Tokens:

Create service tokens for applications:

nova auth create-token --name ""Production API"" --scope ""read:deployments,write:deployments""

Store tokens securely. They are only displayed once at creation.

Token Revocation:

Tokens may be revoked manually or automatically:

- Manual revocation via dashboard or CLI
- Automatic revocation on password change
- Automatic revocation on account suspension
- Automatic revocation on permission changes

List all tokens:

nova auth list-tokens

Revoke compromised tokens immediately:

nova auth revoke-token token-id

Invalid Token Errors:

""Invalid API token"" errors indicate:

- Token has been revoked
- Token has expired
- Token is malformed or corrupted
- Token is for a different environment (staging vs production)

Verify token validity:

curl -H ""Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"" https://api.nova.io/v3/auth/verify

Permission Errors:

""Insufficient permissions"" with valid token indicates scope limitations. Check token scope:

nova auth token-info token-id

Create a new token with required permissions:

nova auth create-token --name ""Full Access"" --scope ""read:,write:""

Token Storage:

Store tokens securely:

- Use environment variables, not hardcoded in code
- Encrypt tokens at rest
- Use secret management services (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- Rotate tokens regularly (every 90 days minimum)

Token Rotation:

Rotate tokens without downtime:

1. Create new token with same permissions
2. Update applications to use new token
3. Verify applications function correctly

doc-api-reference-012,Rate Limiting and Throttling,"The NovaCLI API implements rate limiting to ensure fair resource allocation and system stability. This reference covers rate limits, headers, and handling strategies.

Default Rate Limits:

Tier-based limits:

Free tier:
- 100 requests per hour
- 10 requests per minute
- No burst allowance

Basic tier:
- 1,000 requests per hour
- 50 requests per minute
- Burst: 100 requests

Pro tier:
- 10,000 requests per hour
- 200 requests per minute
- Burst: 500 requests

Enterprise tier:
- Custom limits
- Dedicated rate limit pool
- Burst: Negotiable

Rate Limit Headers:

Every API response includes rate limit headers:

X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 847
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1694785200
X-RateLimit-Resource: deployments

Header descriptions:
- Limit: Maximum requests allowed in window
- Remaining: Requests left in current window
- Reset: Unix timestamp when limit resets
- Resource: Rate limit category

Rate Limit Categories:

Different endpoints have separate limits:

deployments: Deployment operations
backups: Backup operations
metrics: Metrics queries
logs: Log queries
api-keys: Authentication operations

Each category tracked independently.

Rate Limit Exceeded:

When limit exceeded, API returns:

HTTP 429 Too Many Requests

{
  ""status"": ""error"",
  ""error"": {
    ""code"": ""RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED"",
    ""message"": ""Rate limit exceeded. Try again in 45 seconds."",
    ""details"": {
      ""limit"": 1000,
      ""reset_at"": ""2024-09-15T11:00:00Z"",
      ""retry_after"": 45
    }
  }
}

Retry-After header indicates wait time:

Retry-After: 45

Client Handling:

Best practices for handling rate limits:

1. Monitor X-RateLimit-Remaining
2. Implement exponential backoff
3. Respect Retry-After header
4. Cache responses when possible
5. Batch requests when available
6. Use webhooks instead of polling

Example (Python):

import time
import requests

def api_call_with_rate_limit(url, headers):
    while True:
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        
        if response.status_code == 429:
            retry_after = int(response.headers.get('Retry-After', 60))
            print(f""Rate limited. Waiting {retry_after}s"")
            time.sleep(retry_after)
            continue
        
        remaining = int(response.headers.get('X-RateLimit-Remaining', 0))
        if remaining < 10:
            print(f""Warning: Only {remaining} requests remaining"")
        
        return response

Burst Handling:

Burst allowance permits short spikes:

- Accumulated during idle periods
- Maximum: Tier-specific burst limit
- Depletes during high usage
- Refills at standard rate

Burst usage tracked in header:

X-RateLimit-Burst-Remaining: 250

Endpoint-Specific Limits:

Some endpoints have stricter limits:

POST /deployments: 10 per hour
POST /backups/{id}/restore: 5 per hour
POST /users/invite: 20 per day

These override tier defaults.

IP-Based Limiting:

Additional limits per source IP:

- 10,000 requests per hour per IP
- Prevents abuse from single source
- Applies across all API keys

Blocked IPs receive:

HTTP 403 Forbidden
X-RateLimit-Block-Expires: timestamp

Webhooks vs Polling:

Use webhooks to avoid rate limits:

- Webhooks don't count toward limits
- Real-time notifications
- More efficient than polling
- Recommended for event-driven workflows

Rate Limit Increase:

Request limit increase:

1. Upgrade to higher tier
2. Contact enterprise sales
3. Document use case and requirements

doc-config_format-3.1-winner,TOML Configuration Guide for NovaCLI v3.1,"NovaCLI v3.1 uses TOML (Tom's Obvious Minimal Language) as its primary configuration format. This guide covers the structure, syntax, and best practices for creating and maintaining NovaCLI configuration files in the current version.

TOML was adopted in v2.0 to replace YAML due to its stronger typing, better error messages, and reduced ambiguity in parsing. The v3.1 release refined the schema and introduced new configuration sections for improved modularity.

Configuration files are located at ~/.novacli/config.toml by default. You can override this location using the --config flag or the NOVA_CONFIG_PATH environment variable.

The basic structure follows a nested table format:

[server]
host = ""http://api.nova.io""
port = 443
timeout = 30

[auth]
method = ""scram-sha-256""
token_expiry = ""24h""

[logging]
level = ""info""
format = ""json""
output = ""/var/log/nova.log""

String values must be quoted, while integers and booleans remain unquoted. Arrays use square brackets with comma separation: allowed_ips = [""192.168.1.0/24"", ""10.0.0.0/8""].

NovaCLI v3.1 introduced the [profiles] section, allowing multiple environment configurations in a single file:

[profiles.production]
http://server.host = ""http://prod.nova.io""
auth.method = ""certificate""

[profiles.development]
http://server.host = ""http://dev.nova.io""
auth.method = ""basic""

Activate a profile using: nova --profile production settings show

Common errors include mixing tabs and spaces (TOML requires consistent indentation), forgetting quotes around string values containing special characters, and duplicate key definitions. The nova config validate command checks for syntax errors before deployment.

When migrating from older YAML configurations, use the built-in converter: nova config migrate --from config.yaml --to config.toml

doc-configuration-012,Monitoring and Metrics Configuration,"NovaCLI v3.1 provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities through metrics exposition, alerting, and integration with observability platforms. This guide covers metrics configuration and monitoring setup.

Metrics Exposition:

Enable Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint:

[metrics]
enabled = true
port = 9090
path = ""/metrics""

Exposed metrics include:
- Query latency percentiles
- Connection pool utilization
- Error rates by type
- CPU and memory usage
- Disk I/O statistics

Scrape configuration for Prometheus:

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'novacli'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['deployment-host:9090']
    scrape_interval: 15s

Metrics Filtering:

Control which metrics are exposed:

[metrics.filters]
include = [""nova_query_"", ""nova_connection_""]
exclude = [""nova_internal_*""]

Reduces cardinality and improves scrape performance.

Custom Labels:

Add deployment-specific labels:

[metrics.labels]
environment = ""production""
region = ""us-east-1""
team = ""infrastructure""

Labels enable filtering and aggregation in monitoring systems.

Histogram Buckets:

Configure latency histogram buckets:

[metrics.histograms]
query_duration_buckets = [0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0]

Buckets should cover expected latency range.

Health Endpoint:

Expose health status endpoint:

[health]
enabled = true
port = 8080
path = ""/health""

Returns 200 OK if healthy, 503 Service Unavailable if degraded.

Readiness and Liveness:

Separate endpoints for Kubernetes:

[health.liveness]
path = ""/health/live""

[health.readiness]
path = ""/health/ready""

Liveness checks container process. Readiness checks dependency availability.

OpenTelemetry Integration:

Export traces and metrics via OpenTelemetry:

[telemetry.opentelemetry]
enabled = true
exporter = ""otlp""
endpoint = ""http://otel-collector:4317""

Supports distributed tracing across services.

Datadog Integration:

Direct integration with Datadog:

[telemetry.datadog]
enabled = true
api_key = ""${DATADOG_API_KEY}""
site = ""http://datadoghq.com""
tags = [""env:production"", ""service:novacli""]

New Relic Integration:

Send metrics to New Relic:

[telemetry.newrelic]
enabled = true
license_key = ""${NEWRELIC_LICENSE_KEY}""
app_name = ""NovaCLI Production""

Graphite Integration:

Export metrics to Graphite:

[telemetry.graphite]
enabled = true
host = ""http://graphite.company.com""
port = 2003
protocol = ""tcp""
prefix = ""novacli.production""

Sampling Configuration:

Control trace sampling rate:

[telemetry.sampling]
strategy = ""probabilistic""
rate = 0.1  # Sample 10% of traces

Reduces overhead for high-traffic deployments.

Metrics Retention:

Configure internal metrics buffer:

[metrics.retention]
buffer_size = 10000
flush_interval = 10  # seconds

Buffers metrics during collector outages.

Performance Impact:

Metrics collection overhead:
- CPU: <2%
- Memory: ~50MB

doc-getting-started-004,Quick Start Guide,"This quick start guide walks you through creating your first deployment with NovaCLI v3.1 in under five minutes. Before starting, ensure you've installed NovaCLI and authenticated with your account.

Verify your installation and authentication status:

nova auth whoami

This displays your username and active organization. If you see an error, run nova auth login to authenticate.

Create a new deployment using the interactive wizard:

nova deploy create --interactive

The wizard prompts for:
- Deployment name: Choose a descriptive identifier
- Region: Select from available regions based on your requirements
- Instance size: Pick a size matching your workload
- Environment: Specify development, staging, or production

Alternatively, create a deployment using command-line flags:

nova deploy create --name my-app --region us-west-2 --size medium --env production

NovaCLI creates the deployment and displays its ID. Track deployment progress:

nova deploy status <deployment-id>

Deployments typically complete within 2-3 minutes. Status transitions from ""provisioning"" to ""configuring"" to ""active.""

Once active, retrieve connection information:

nova deploy info <deployment-id>

This displays endpoints, credentials, and configuration details needed to connect your application.

View deployment logs in real-time:

nova logs tail <deployment-id>

Press Ctrl+C to stop streaming logs.

Update deployment configuration as needed:

nova settings set deployment.<deployment-id>.size large

Changes apply during the next deployment update cycle.

When finished with a deployment, remove it to avoid charges:

nova deploy delete <deployment-id> --confirm

For production deployments, use the --no-confirm flag requires explicit confirmation to prevent accidental deletion.

Explore additional commands:

nova deploy list: View all deployments

doc-migration-008,Zero-Downtime Migration Strategies,"Minimizing downtime during migration is critical for production systems. This guide presents strategies for near-zero-downtime migrations between NovaCLI versions.

Blue-Green Deployment:

Maintain two identical environments during migration:

Blue Environment (current):
- Production traffic
- v2.x deployment
- Stable and tested

Green Environment (new):
- No traffic initially
- v3.x deployment
- Testing and validation

Procedure:

1. Create green environment:
   nova deploy clone production-id --name production-v3

2. Upgrade green to v3.x:
   nova deploy upgrade production-v3 --version 3.1

3. Sync data from blue to green:
   nova deploy replicate production-id --target production-v3

4. Test green thoroughly

5. Switch traffic to green:
   Update load balancer or DNS

6. Monitor green environment

7. Decommission blue after validation period

Downtime: 0-5 seconds during traffic switch

Rolling Upgrade:

For multi-instance deployments, upgrade instances one at a time:

1. Remove instance from load balancer
2. Upgrade instance
3. Validate instance health
4. Return instance to load balancer
5. Repeat for remaining instances

Command:
nova deploy upgrade deployment-id --version 3.1 --strategy rolling

Downtime: None (requires multi-instance deployment)

Read Replica Promotion:

Create replica, upgrade it, then promote to primary:

1. Create read replica:
   nova deploy create-replica production-id --name production-replica

2. Upgrade replica:
   nova deploy upgrade production-replica --version 3.1

3. Monitor replication lag:
   nova deploy replication-status production-id

4. When lag is minimal, promote replica:
   nova deploy promote-replica production-replica

5. Old primary becomes replica or is decommissioned

Downtime: 30-60 seconds during promotion

Maintenance Window Optimization:

If some downtime is acceptable, minimize it:

1. Pre-download upgrade packages:
   nova deploy prepare-upgrade deployment-id --version 3.1

2. Validate upgrade readiness:
   nova deploy validate-upgrade deployment-id

3. Schedule upgrade during low-traffic period:
   nova deploy upgrade deployment-id --version 3.1 --scheduled-at ""03:00""

4. Automated health checks restart traffic when ready

Typical downtime: 2-5 minutes

Database Connection Pooling:

Connection pools help applications tolerate brief connectivity interruptions:

- Configure retry logic
- Set connection timeout to 30+ seconds
- Enable automatic reconnection
- Use circuit breakers for failed connections

Application-level retry example:
python
for attempt in range(3):
    try:
        result = database.query(sql)
        break
    except ConnectionError:
        if attempt < 2:
            time.sleep(5)
        else:
            raise


Monitoring During Migration:

Real-time monitoring detects issues immediately:

- Error rates
- Response times
- Connection counts
- Query performance
- Resource utilization

Set up alerts for:
- Error rate > 1%
- Response time > 2x baseline
- Failed health checks

Risk Mitigation:

Reduce migration risk:
- Test in staging first
- Migrate during lowest traffic period
- Have rollback plan ready

doc-troubleshooting-003,Performance Degradation in Deployments,"Deployment performance can degrade over time due to resource exhaustion, suboptimal configuration, or data growth. This guide helps identify and resolve common performance bottlenecks in NovaCLI v3.1 deployments.

Diagnosing Performance Issues:

Start by collecting performance metrics:

nova deploy stats deployment-id --detailed

This displays CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, network throughput, and query performance statistics. Look for metrics consistently above 80% of capacity.

CPU Saturation:

High CPU usage (above 90%) indicates compute-bound workloads. Common causes include inefficient queries, missing indexes, or undersized deployment instances. Review slow queries:

nova logs deployment-id --filter ""duration > 1000""

This shows queries taking longer than 1 second. Optimize these queries or add appropriate indexes.

Memory Pressure:

Memory exhaustion causes performance degradation and potential out-of-memory crashes. If memory usage consistently exceeds 85%, consider upgrading to a larger deployment size:

nova deploy resize deployment-id --size large

Alternatively, tune memory-related configuration parameters to reduce memory consumption.

Disk I/O Bottlenecks:

High disk I/O wait times indicate storage-bound workloads. This commonly affects write-heavy applications or deployments with insufficient IOPS capacity. Upgrade to SSD-backed storage tiers for better performance:

nova deploy update deployment-id --storage-tier ssd

Connection Pool Exhaustion:

If you see ""connection pool exhausted"" errors, your application is creating more concurrent connections than configured. Increase the connection limit:

nova deploy update deployment-id --max-connections 200

Monitor connection usage to determine appropriate limits.

Query Performance:

Slow queries are a leading cause of performance degradation. Enable query logging to identify problematic queries:

nova deploy update deployment-id --enable-slow-query-log --slow-query-threshold 500

This logs queries taking longer than 500 milliseconds.

Resource Monitoring:

Set up continuous monitoring and alerts:

doc-migration-009,Post-Migration Validation and Testing,"Thorough validation after migration ensures stability and correctness. This guide covers comprehensive post-migration testing procedures for NovaCLI upgrades.

Validation Phases:

Phase 1: Immediate Validation (0-2 hours)
Phase 2: Functional Testing (2-24 hours)
Phase 3: Performance Monitoring (1-7 days)
Phase 4: Long-term Stability (7-30 days)

Immediate Validation:

Run immediately after migration completes:

1. Health checks:
   nova deploy health deployment-id

2. Version verification:
   nova deploy get deployment-id --format json | jq '.version'

3. Connectivity test:
   nova deploy query deployment-id --query ""SELECT 1""

4. Log review:
   nova logs deployment-id --since 1h --level error

5. Resource metrics:
   nova deploy stats deployment-id

Expected results:
- Health: ""healthy"" status
- Version: Target version (e.g., ""3.1.0"")
- Connectivity: Query returns ""1""
- Logs: No critical errors
- Metrics: CPU/memory within normal range

Functional Testing:

Validate application functionality:

1. Authentication:
   - User login/logout
   - Token generation
   - Permission checks

2. Core Operations:
   - Data reads
   - Data writes
   - Updates and deletes
   - Bulk operations

3. Integration Points:
   - External API calls
   - Webhook deliveries
   - Scheduled jobs
   - Backup operations

4. Edge Cases:
   - Large queries
   - Concurrent operations
   - Error handling
   - Timeout scenarios

Automated Test Suite:

Run regression tests:

bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo ""Running post-migration tests...""

# Test basic operations
nova deploy query deployment-id --query ""SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users""
nova deploy query deployment-id --query ""INSERT INTO test_table VALUES (1, 'test')""

# Test new v3.1 features
nova deploy dashboard deployment-id --format json > /dev/null

# Test backups
backup_id=$(nova backup create deployment-id --format json | jq -r '.id')
nova backup verify $backup_id

echo ""All tests passed""


Performance Validation:

Compare performance metrics pre and post-migration:

1. Query response times:
   - Baseline (pre-migration)
   - Current (post-migration)
   - Acceptable variance: ±10%

2. Throughput:
   - Requests per second
   - Transactions per minute

3. Resource utilization:
   - CPU usage
   - Memory consumption
   - Disk I/O
   - Network bandwidth

4. Connection metrics:
   - Active connections
   - Connection pool utilization
   - Connection wait times

Benchmarking:

Run performance benchmarks:

nova deploy benchmark deployment-id --duration 300

Compare results to pre-migration baseline.

Data Integrity Verification:

Ensure data correctness:

1. Row counts:
   Compare pre and post-migration counts

2. Checksums:
   Validate critical data hasn't changed

3. Foreign key integrity:
   nova deploy check-integrity deployment-id

4. Sample validation:
   Manually review sample records

Application-Level Testing:

Test from application perspective:

1. End-to-end user workflows
2. Critical business transactions
3. Reporting and analytics
4. Batch processing jobs
5. Scheduled tasks

Monitoring and Alerting:

Enhanced monitoring post-migration:

1. Set tighter alert thresholds temporarily
2. Increase monitoring frequency
3. Enable detailed logging
4. Review dashboards regularly

Documentation:

Record validation results:
- Tests performed
- Results and metrics
- Issues discovered
- Resolutions applied
- Sign-off from stakeholders

Go/No-Go Decision:

Determine if migration is successful:

Go criteria:
✓ All health checks pass
✓ No critical errors in logs
✓ Performance within acceptable range
✓ Core functionality working
✓ Integration tests pass

No-Go criteria (rollback required):
✗ Critical functionality broken
✗ Data loss or corruption

doc-api-reference-013,Pagination and Filtering Best Practices,"The NovaCLI API provides flexible pagination and filtering for list endpoints. This reference covers optimal strategies for efficient data retrieval and client implementation patterns.

Pagination Methods:

Offset-based pagination:

GET /deployments?limit=50&offset=100

Advantages:
- Simple implementation
- Can jump to specific pages
- Predictable behavior

Disadvantages:
- Inefficient for large offsets
- Results may shift with concurrent changes
- Poor performance at high offsets

Cursor-based pagination:

GET /deployments?limit=50&cursor=eyJpZCI6MTIzfQ

Advantages:
- Consistent results during iteration
- Efficient for large datasets
- Handles concurrent changes gracefully

Disadvantages:
- Cannot jump to specific page
- Cursor opaque to clients

Recommendation: Use cursor-based for production systems, offset for user-facing page navigation.

Pagination Response:

Standard pagination metadata:

{
  ""status"": ""success"",
  ""data"": [...],
  ""pagination"": {
    ""limit"": 50,
    ""offset"": 100,
    ""total"": 250,
    ""has_more"": true,
    ""next_cursor"": ""eyJpZCI6MTUwfQ"",
    ""next_url"": ""/deployments?limit=50&cursor=eyJpZCI6MTUwfQ""
  }
}

Iterating Through Results:

Offset-based iteration:

offset = 0
limit = 50
while True:
    response = get(f""/deployments?limit={limit}&offset={offset}"")
    if not response['data']:
        break
    process(response['data'])
    offset += limit

Cursor-based iteration:

cursor = None
limit = 50
while True:
    url = f""/deployments?limit={limit}""
    if cursor:
        url += f""&cursor={cursor}""
    response = get(url)
    if not response['data']:
        break
    process(response['data'])
    cursor = response['pagination']['next_cursor']
    if not cursor:
        break

Filtering:

Supported filter types:

Equality filters:
GET /deployments?status=active&region=us-east-1

Multiple values (OR):
GET /deployments?status=active,stopped

Range filters:
GET /deployments?created_after=2024-09-01&created_before=2024-09-15

Pattern matching:
GET /deployments?name_like=prod-%

Array contains:
GET /deployments?tags_contain=production

Negation filters:
GET /deployments?status_not=failed

Filter Combinations:

Multiple filters use AND logic:

GET /deployments?status=active&region=us-east-1&size=large

Returns: active AND us-east-1 AND large

Complex filtering requires multiple values:

GET /deployments?status=active,stopped&region=us-east-1

Returns: (active OR stopped) AND us-east-1

Sorting:

Single field sort:
GET /deployments?sort=created_at

Descending order:
GET /deployments?sort=-created_at

Multiple fields:
GET /deployments?sort=region,-created_at

Sorts by region ascending, then created_at descending.

Field Selection:

Reduce payload size:

GET /deployments?fields=id,name,status

Returns only specified fields.

Full response (default):
GET /deployments

Performance Optimization:

Limit considerations:
- Small limits: More requests, lower latency
- Large limits: Fewer requests, higher latency
- Recommended: 50-100 for balance
- Maximum: 1000 per request

Index-friendly filters:
- Filter by indexed fields (id, created_at, status)
- Avoid pattern matching on large datasets
- Combine with sorting on indexed fields

Caching:
- Cache results for read-heavy workloads
- Use ETags for conditional requests
- Invalidate on write operations

Parallel Requests:

Fetch multiple pages simultaneously:

- Use cursor pagination
- Maintain order client-side
- Respect rate limits
- Handle cursor expiration

Error Handling:

Invalid cursor:
{
  ""error"": {
    ""code"": ""INVALID_CURSOR"",
    ""message"": ""Cursor expired or invalid""
  }
}

Response: Start over from beginning.

Filter validation error:
{
  ""error"": {
    ""code"": ""INVALID_FILTER"",
    ""message"": ""Field 'status' does not support operator 'gt'""

doc-configuration-014,Notification Configuration,"NovaCLI v3.1 sends notifications for deployment events, alerts, and errors through multiple channels. This guide covers configuring email, Slack, webhook, and PagerDuty notifications.

Email Notifications:

Configure SMTP for email alerts:

[http://notifications.email]
enabled = true
smtp_host = ""http://smtp.gmail.com""
smtp_port = 587
smtp_user = ""mailto:notifications@company.com""
smtp_password = ""${SMTP_PASSWORD}""
from_address = ""mailto:novacli@company.com""

Recipient configuration:

[http://notifications.email.recipients]
default = [""mailto:ops-team@company.com""]
critical = [""mailto:ops-team@company.com"", ""mailto:oncall@company.com""]
info = [""mailto:logs@company.com""]

Slack Integration:

Send notifications to Slack channels:

[notifications.slack]
enabled = true
webhook_url = ""${SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL}""
default_channel = ""#deployments""
username = ""NovaCLI""
icon_emoji = "":rocket:""

Channel routing by severity:

[notifications.slack.routing]
critical = ""#incidents""
warning = ""#alerts""
info = ""#deployments""

Webhook Notifications:

Send HTTP POST to custom endpoint:

[notifications.webhook]
enabled = true
url = ""https://webhook.company.com/novacli""
method = ""POST""
headers = {""Authorization"" = ""Bearer ${WEBHOOK_TOKEN}""}
timeout = 10

Payload format:

{
  ""event"": ""deployment.failed"",
  ""deployment_id"": ""dep-abc123"",
  ""timestamp"": ""2024-09-15T10:30:00Z"",
  ""severity"": ""critical"",
  ""message"": ""Deployment failed: connection timeout""
}

PagerDuty Integration:

Create PagerDuty incidents for critical events:

[notifications.pagerduty]
enabled = true
integration_key = ""${PAGERDUTY_INTEGRATION_KEY}""
severity_threshold = ""critical""

Only critical events trigger pages.

Microsoft Teams:

Post to Teams channels:

[notifications.teams]
enabled = true
webhook_url = ""${TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL}""

Event Filtering:

Control which events trigger notifications:

[notifications.filters]
events = [
  ""deployment.created"",
  ""deployment.failed"",
  ""backup.completed"",
  ""certificate.expiring""
]

Exclude noisy events:

[notifications.filters]
exclude_events = [
  ""deployment.stats_updated"",
  ""connection.established""
]

Severity-Based Routing:

Route by severity level:

[notifications.routing]
critical = [""pagerduty"", ""slack"", ""email""]
warning = [""slack"", ""email""]
info = [""slack""]

Critical events use all channels; info uses only Slack.

Quiet Hours:

Suppress non-critical notifications during off-hours:

[notifications.quiet_hours]
enabled = true
start = ""22:00""
end = ""08:00""
timezone = ""America/New_York""
except_severity = [""critical""]

Critical events always notify.

Rate Limiting:

Prevent notification storms:

[notifications.rate_limiting]
max_per_hour = 50
max_burst = 10

Throttles excessive notifications from cascading failures.

Notification Templates:

Customize message format:

[notifications.templates]
deployment_failed = ""⚠️ Deployment .DeploymentID failed: .Error""
backup_completed = ""✅ Backup completed for .DeploymentID""

Digest Mode:

Batch notifications into periodic summaries:

[notifications.digest]
enabled = true
interval = 3600  # seconds

doc-logging-3.1-winner,Structured Logging Configuration in NovaCLI v3.1,"NovaCLI v3.1 implements structured logging using JSON format by default, providing machine-readable output that integrates seamlessly with modern observability platforms. This guide covers logging configuration, output formats, and best practices for production deployments.

Structured logging replaced plain text logs in v2.0, and v3.1 refined the schema to include additional context fields for distributed tracing and correlation. Each log entry now includes timestamp, level, message, source location, and custom metadata.

Logging configuration resides in the [logging] section of config.toml:

[logging]
level = ""info""
format = ""json""
output = ""/var/log/novacli/app.log""
max_size_mb = 100
max_backups = 5
compress = true

[logging.fields]
service = ""novacli""
environment = ""production""
version = ""3.1.0""

Log levels follow standard severity ordering: debug, info, warn, error, fatal. Set the level to control verbosity. Debug logs include detailed internal state and are suitable for troubleshooting but generate significant volume in production.

JSON format enables structured querying in log aggregation systems:

{""timestamp"":""2024-09-15T14:32:10Z"",""level"":""info"",""message"":""deployment started"",""deployment_id"":""dep-12345"",""user"":""admin"",""service"":""novacli"",""environment"":""production""}

For human-readable output during development, use format = ""text"":

2024-09-15 14:32:10 INFO deployment started deployment_id=dep-12345 user=admin

Log rotation prevents disk exhaustion. The max_size_mb setting triggers rotation when log files reach the specified size. The max_backups setting limits retained historical files. Enable compression to reduce storage costs.

Custom fields in [logging.fields] appear in every log entry, providing consistent context for filtering and aggregation. Add fields for service name, environment, region, or any metadata relevant to your infrastructure.

Dynamic log level adjustment allows runtime changes without restart:

nova settings set logging.level debug
nova settings reload

Integration with external logging systems requires configuring output destinations. NovaCLI supports file, stdout, and syslog outputs:

output = ""stdout"" # For container environments
output = ""syslog://http://localhost:514"" # For centralized logging

doc-troubleshooting-016,Addressing High CPU Usage,"High CPU usage impacts deployment responsiveness and can trigger throttling or crashes. Identifying CPU-intensive operations and optimizing them restores normal performance in NovaCLI v3.1.

Monitoring CPU Usage:

Track CPU metrics over time:

nova deploy stats deployment-id --metric cpu --duration 24h

Sustained usage above 80% indicates performance issues requiring investigation.

Identifying CPU Consumers:

Profile CPU usage to find hot spots:

nova deploy profile deployment-id --type cpu --duration 300

This samples CPU activity for 5 minutes and reports the top consumers by function or component.

Query-Related CPU Usage:

Inefficient queries often cause high CPU. Identify expensive queries:

nova deploy top-queries deployment-id --order-by cpu

Optimize queries using indexes, query rewriting, or caching.

Background Jobs:

Maintenance operations consume CPU. Check active jobs:

nova deploy jobs deployment-id

Reschedule intensive jobs to off-peak hours:

nova deploy schedule-job deployment-id vacuum --time ""02:00"" --frequency weekly

Connection Overhead:

Excessive connection churn increases CPU usage. Monitor connection statistics:

nova deploy connections deployment-id --stats

Use connection pooling to reduce overhead:

nova deploy update deployment-id --enable-connection-pooling --pool-size 50

Encryption Overhead:

SSL/TLS encryption consumes CPU. For internal deployments where encryption isn't required, disable SSL:

nova deploy update deployment-id --ssl-mode disabled

Only disable encryption for non-production or isolated environments.

Compression:

Data compression trades CPU for I/O efficiency. If CPU-bound, reduce compression:

nova deploy update deployment-id --compression-level low

Vertical Scaling:

If optimization doesn't reduce CPU usage sufficiently, scale to more CPU cores:

nova deploy resize deployment-id --size cpu-optimized-large

CPU-optimized instance types provide more compute capacity.

Load Distribution:

For read-heavy workloads, distribute load across replicas:

nova deploy create-replica deployment-id --region us-east

doc-migration-011,Migrating Between Cloud Regions,"Moving NovaCLI deployments between geographic regions requires careful planning to maintain data integrity and minimize downtime. This guide covers cross-region migration strategies.

Reasons for Region Migration:

Common migration drivers:
- Regulatory compliance (GDPR, data sovereignty)
- Latency optimization (moving closer to users)
- Cost reduction (regional pricing differences)
- Disaster recovery planning
- Cloud provider availability

Pre-Migration Planning:

Assess migration requirements:

1. Data volume and transfer time:
   Estimate based on deployment size and network bandwidth

2. Network costs:
   Cross-region data transfer incurs charges

3. Compliance requirements:
   Verify target region meets regulatory needs

4. Service availability:
   Confirm all required features available in target region

Migration Methods:

Method 1: Backup and Restore

Best for: Small to medium deployments (<100GB)

Procedure:
1. Create backup in source region:
   nova backup create source-deployment-id

2. Create new deployment in target region:
   nova deploy create --region target-region --name new-deployment

3. Restore backup to target:
   nova backup restore backup-id --target new-deployment-id

4. Validate data integrity

5. Update application connection strings

6. Delete source deployment

Downtime: Duration of backup + restore (30 min to 2 hours)

Method 2: Cross-Region Replication

Best for: Large deployments, minimal downtime requirements

Procedure:
1. Create read replica in target region:
   nova deploy create-replica source-id --region target-region

2. Monitor replication lag:
   nova deploy replication-status source-id

3. When lag is minimal (<5 seconds), promote replica:
   nova deploy promote-replica replica-id

4. Update application to use new primary

5. Decommission old primary

Downtime: 30-60 seconds during promotion

Method 3: Dual-Write Pattern

Best for: Zero-downtime requirement, complex applications

Procedure:
1. Create deployment in target region

2. Configure application to write to both regions

3. Backfill historical data to target

4. Verify target region data completeness

5. Switch reads to target region

6. Stop writes to source region

7. Decommission source

Downtime: None (requires application changes)

Data Transfer Considerations:

Optimize large data transfers:

1. Compression:
   nova backup create source-id --compress

2. Incremental transfer:
   Transfer in chunks during off-peak hours

3. Parallel streams:
   Use multiple connection streams for faster transfer

Network costs:
Monitor data transfer charges. Cross-region transfer typically costs $0.02-0.12 per GB.

DNS and Connection Updates:

Update application connections:

1. DNS changes:
   Update DNS records to point to new region
   Set low TTL before migration for quick propagation

2. Connection strings:
   Update application configuration with new endpoint

3. Load balancers:
   Reconfigure to route to new region

4. VPN connections:
   Update VPN peering if using private connectivity

Validation:

Verify successful migration:

1. Data completeness:
   Compare row counts between source and target

2. Application functionality:
   Test all critical features

3. Performance:
   Measure query latency from application servers

4. Compliance:
   Verify data residency requirements met

Rollback Plan:

Prepare for migration failure:

1. Keep source deployment running during validation period
2. Maintain backup from just before migration
3. Document DNS rollback procedure
4. Define rollback decision criteria

Cost Analysis:

Calculate migration costs:
- Data transfer fees
- Temporary dual-deployment costs

doc-api-reference-026,API Rate Limiting and Throttling,"NovaCLI v3.1 interacts with the Nova REST API, which enforces rate limits to ensure fair resource allocation and service stability. Understanding rate limits helps you design resilient integrations and avoid 429 Too Many Requests errors.

Rate Limit Tiers:

The API applies different rate limits based on your account tier:

- Free tier: 100 requests per minute, 10,000 requests per day
- Pro tier: 500 requests per minute, 100,000 requests per day
- Enterprise tier: 2,000 requests per minute, 1,000,000 requests per day

Rate Limit Headers:

Every API response includes headers indicating your current rate limit status:

X-RateLimit-Limit: Maximum requests allowed in the current window
X-RateLimit-Remaining: Requests remaining in the current window
X-RateLimit-Reset: Unix timestamp when the rate limit resets

Handling Rate Limits:

When you exceed your rate limit, the API returns a 429 status code with a Retry-After header indicating seconds to wait before retrying. Implement exponential backoff in your integration:

1. Check X-RateLimit-Remaining before making requests
2. If you receive a 429, wait for the duration specified in Retry-After
3. Implement exponential backoff: double wait time after each consecutive 429
4. Use batch endpoints when available to reduce request count

Burst Allowance:

All tiers include a burst allowance of 2x the per-minute limit for short periods. This accommodates temporary spikes without triggering errors. However, sustained traffic above your tier limit will result in throttling.

Request Prioritization:

The API prioritizes requests in this order:

1. Health checks and monitoring
2. Write operations (create, update, delete)
3. Read operations (list, get)

doc-configuration-001,Performance Tuning Configuration,"NovaCLI v3.1 provides numerous configuration options for optimizing deployment performance. This guide covers the most impactful settings for improving throughput, reducing latency, and maximizing resource utilization.

Connection Pool Configuration:

Connection pooling significantly impacts application performance. Configure pool size based on your workload:

[database]
max_connections = 100
min_connections = 10
connection_timeout = 30

Max connections should be 2-3x your expected concurrent queries. Too high wastes resources; too low creates bottlenecks.

Query Performance:

Enable query caching for frequently executed queries:

[performance]
query_cache_enabled = true
query_cache_size_mb = 256
query_cache_ttl = 300

Cache TTL balances freshness against performance. Adjust based on your data update frequency.

Resource Allocation:

Tune memory allocation for optimal performance:

[resources]
shared_buffers = ""4GB""
work_mem = ""64MB""
maintenance_work_mem = ""512MB""
effective_cache_size = ""12GB""

Shared buffers should be 25% of system RAM. Work_mem affects sort and hash operations; higher values speed complex queries but increase memory usage.

Checkpoint Configuration:

Checkpoints write dirty buffers to disk. Tuning reduces I/O spikes:

[checkpoint]
max_wal_size = ""2GB""
min_wal_size = ""1GB""
checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9

Higher checkpoint completion target spreads I/O over longer periods, reducing spikes.

Vacuum Settings:

Automatic vacuuming maintains performance:

[autovacuum]
autovacuum_enabled = true
autovacuum_max_workers = 3
autovacuum_naptime = 60

More workers handle large databases faster but consume additional resources.

Network Configuration:

Optimize network settings for your deployment:

[network]
tcp_keepalives_idle = 60
tcp_keepalives_interval = 10
tcp_keepalives_count = 5

Keepalives detect broken connections, preventing resource leaks.

Monitor performance impact:

nova deploy stats <deployment-id> --detailed

Compare metrics before and after tuning. Adjust incrementally rather than changing multiple settings simultaneously.

Performance testing:

doc-getting-started-006,Creating Your First Deployment,"After installing and authenticating with NovaCLI v3.1, you're ready to create your first deployment. This tutorial walks through the deployment creation process step by step, explaining each configuration option.

Start by listing available regions to understand where you can deploy:

nova regions list

This displays all regions, their current capacity status, and approximate latency from your location. Choose a region close to your users for optimal performance.

Next, review available instance sizes:

nova sizes list

Instance sizes range from small (suitable for development and testing) to extra-large (designed for production workloads with high traffic). Each size displays CPU cores, RAM, storage, and hourly cost.

Create your deployment using the interactive wizard for a guided experience:

nova deploy create --interactive

The wizard asks for:

Deployment name: Choose a meaningful identifier. Names must be unique within your organization and can contain letters, numbers, and hyphens.

Region: Select from the list displayed earlier. Consider data residency requirements and user proximity.

Instance size: Match your workload requirements. Start small and scale up as needed. Resizing is non-disruptive in v3.1.

Environment type: Specify development, staging, or production. This tag affects monitoring, logging verbosity, and backup schedules.

Database engine: Choose PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB. Each engine version is listed with its end-of-life date.

Alternatively, provide all parameters via flags for automation:

nova deploy create --name my-first-app --region us-east-1 --size medium --env development --engine postgresql-15

NovaCLI validates your inputs and displays a cost estimate. Confirm to proceed. The deployment process takes 3-5 minutes.

Monitor progress:

nova deploy status <deployment-id> --watch

The --watch flag refreshes status automatically until deployment completes. Status progresses through: queued, provisioning, configuring, starting, active.

Once active, retrieve connection details:

nova deploy info <deployment-id> --format json

doc-migration-015,Lessons Learned: Common Migration Pitfalls,"Learning from common migration mistakes helps avoid costly errors. This guide documents frequently encountered pitfalls and how to avoid them.

Insufficient Testing:

Pitfall: Migrating to production without adequate testing

Consequences:
- Unexpected issues in production
- Extended downtime
- Data integrity problems
- Forced rollback

Prevention:
1. Always test in staging first
2. Replicate production environment closely
3. Test rollback procedures
4. Validate with real workload patterns
5. Include edge cases in testing

Poor Communication:

Pitfall: Inadequate stakeholder communication

Consequences:
- Surprised users during downtime
- Business disruption
- Lack of management support
- Insufficient resources allocated

Prevention:
1. Announce migration 2-4 weeks in advance
2. Send reminders at regular intervals
3. Provide specific downtime windows
4. Establish communication channels
5. Post-migration status updates

Underestimating Migration Time:

Pitfall: Insufficient time allocated for migration

Consequences:
- Rushed execution
- Incomplete validation
- Migration during business hours
- Inadequate troubleshooting time

Prevention:
1. Test in staging to estimate duration
2. Add 50% buffer to estimate
3. Schedule during lowest-traffic period
4. Plan for unexpected delays
5. Have rollback time limit

Missing Backups:

Pitfall: Migrating without recent backups

Consequences:
- No rollback option
- Risk of data loss
- Extended recovery time
- Potential data corruption

Prevention:
1. Create backup immediately before migration
2. Verify backup integrity
3. Test restore procedure
4. Keep multiple backup generations
5. Document backup location and credentials

Ignoring Dependencies:

Pitfall: Not accounting for external dependencies

Consequences:
- Broken integrations
- Third-party service failures
- API incompatibilities
- Authentication issues

Prevention:
1. Map all external dependencies
2. Verify API compatibility
3. Update integration configurations
4. Test integrations in staging
5. Coordinate with third-party vendors

Skipping Rollback Planning:

Pitfall: No rollback strategy defined

Consequences:
- Prolonged outage if issues occur
- Panic decision-making
- Incomplete rollback
- Data loss risk

Prevention:
1. Define rollback triggers beforehand
2. Document rollback procedure
3. Test rollback in staging
4. Set rollback time limits
5. Assign rollback decision authority

Inadequate Monitoring:

Pitfall: Insufficient monitoring during migration

Consequences:
- Issues go undetected
- Delayed problem response
- Incomplete validation
- Performance degradation

Prevention:
1. Enhanced monitoring during migration
2. Real-time dashboards
3. Alert thresholds tightened
4. Dedicated monitoring personnel
5. Historical baseline for comparison

Configuration Drift:

Pitfall: Staging and production configurations differ

Consequences:
- Staging tests don't reflect production
- Unexpected production behavior
- Migration failures in production

Prevention:
1. Configuration management tools
2. Regular staging-production sync
3. Documented configuration differences
4. Automated configuration validation

Premature Decommissioning:

Pitfall: Deleting old deployment too quickly

Consequences:
- No rollback option
- Lost data or configuration
- Extended recovery if issues found

Prevention:
1. Validation period before decommissioning
2. Keep old deployment for 7-30 days
3. Monitor new deployment thoroughly
4. Final stakeholder sign-off required

Lack of Training:

Pitfall: Team unprepared for new version

Consequences:
- Operational errors
- Inefficient troubleshooting
- Underutilization of new features
- Support burden

Prevention:
1. Training sessions before migration
2. Documentation updates
3. Hands-on practice in staging
4. Post-migration support available

Best Practices Summary:

1. Test thoroughly in staging
2. Communicate early and often
3. Buffer time estimates significantly
4. Always have recent backups
5. Map and test dependencies
6. Plan and practice rollback
7. Monitor intensively
8. Validate configuration parity
9. Delay decommissioning old resources
10. Train team adequately

Post-Mortem Process:

After every migration:
1. Document what went well
2. Identify issues encountered
3. Record time spent
4. Gather team feedback
5. Update procedures for next time

doc-configuration-002,SSL/TLS Certificate Configuration,"NovaCLI v3.1 deployments use SSL/TLS encryption by default. This guide covers custom certificate configuration for organizations with specific security requirements or internal certificate authorities.

Default Certificate Behavior:

NovaCLI automatically provisions Let's Encrypt certificates for all deployments. Certificates renew automatically 30 days before expiration.

Custom Certificate Installation:

For custom certificates, provide certificate, private key, and CA chain:

nova settings set deployment.<deployment-id>.tls.cert_file /path/to/certificate.pem
nova settings set deployment.<deployment-id>.tls.key_file /path/to/private-key.pem
nova settings set deployment.<deployment-id>.http://tls.ca_file /path/to/ca-chain.pem

Reload configuration to apply:

nova deploy reload <deployment-id>

Certificate Requirements:

Certificates must meet these criteria:
- PEM format
- Valid for deployment hostname
- RSA 2048-bit or higher, or ECDSA P-256 or higher
- Not expired
- Complete certificate chain included

Validate certificate before installation:

openssl x509 -in certificate.pem -text -noout

Verify subject alternative names match your deployment hostname.

Client Certificate Authentication:

For mutual TLS authentication, enable client certificate verification:

[tls]
client_cert_required = true
client_ca_file = ""/path/to/client-ca.pem""

Only clients presenting valid certificates signed by the specified CA can connect.

Cipher Suite Configuration:

Restrict allowed cipher suites for enhanced security:

[tls]
min_protocol_version = ""TLSv1.3""
cipher_suites = ""TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256""

Balance security against client compatibility. Older clients may not support TLS 1.3.

Certificate Monitoring:

Monitor certificate expiration:

nova deploy cert-status <deployment-id>

Displays expiration date, issuer, and validity status.

Set expiration alerts:

nova alerts create 
  --type cert-expiration 
  --deployment <deployment-id> 
  --threshold 30 
  --email mailto:security@company.com

Receive notifications 30 days before expiration.

Troubleshooting:

Common certificate issues:

- Hostname mismatch: Certificate CN or SAN must match deployment hostname
- Incomplete chain: Include all intermediate certificates
- Wrong key: Private key must match certificate public key
- Expired certificate: Check validity dates

doc-getting-started-007,Understanding Regions and Availability Zones,"NovaCLI v3.1 operates across multiple geographic regions and availability zones to provide low-latency access and high availability for your deployments. Understanding the region architecture helps you make informed decisions about deployment placement.

Regions represent physically separate geographic areas. Each region operates independently with its own infrastructure, power, and networking. NovaCLI currently supports 15 regions across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and South America.

List all regions:

nova regions list --details

This displays region codes (us-east-1, eu-west-2), human-readable names, continent, and operational status. Regions marked as ""limited capacity"" may have longer provisioning times.

Availability zones are isolated locations within regions. Each zone has independent power, cooling, and networking to protect against localized failures. Production deployments can span multiple zones for fault tolerance.

When creating a deployment, specify a region but not an availability zone. NovaCLI automatically selects zones based on current capacity and balancing algorithms. Multi-zone deployments distribute replicas across zones automatically.

For high availability configurations:

nova deploy create --name ha-app --region us-west-1 --ha-mode multi-zone --replicas 3

This creates a deployment with three replicas distributed across availability zones. If one zone fails, the remaining replicas continue serving traffic.

Network latency varies between regions. Test latency from your location:

nova regions ping

This performs latency tests to all regions and ranks them by response time. Choose regions with <50ms latency for interactive applications.

Data residency regulations may require keeping data within specific geographic boundaries. Regions are grouped by regulatory framework:

- US regions: Compliant with US data protection standards
- EU regions: GDPR compliant
- APAC regions: Varied compliance depending on specific requirements

Check region compliance:

nova regions info <region-code> --compliance

Cross-region replication enables disaster recovery by maintaining copies in geographically distant regions. Configure during deployment creation or add later:

doc-troubleshooting-008,Troubleshooting Log Collection Failures,"Log collection is essential for debugging deployment issues. When log retrieval fails in NovaCLI v3.1, several factors may be responsible, from permissions to retention policies.

Log Access Permissions:

Insufficient permissions are the most common cause of log collection failures. Error: ""Permission denied: cannot access logs for deployment."" Verify your role has log access:

nova auth status

The Viewer role and above can read logs. If you lack permissions, request a role upgrade from your administrator.

Log Retention Limits:

Logs older than your plan's retention period are automatically deleted. Free plans retain 7 days, Pro retains 30 days, Enterprise retains 90 days. Attempting to retrieve older logs fails with ""No logs available for specified time range.""

Query the available log time range:

nova logs deployment-id --available-range

This shows the earliest and latest log timestamps.

Large Log Queries:

Querying large log volumes may timeout. Error: ""Log query exceeded maximum execution time."" Narrow your query with filters:

nova logs deployment-id --since ""2024-09-01"" --until ""2024-09-02"" --level error

Filtering by level, source, or time range reduces data volume and improves query performance.

Log Streaming Issues:

Real-time log streaming (nova logs --follow) may disconnect due to network instability. The connection automatically reconnects, but gaps may occur during disconnection. For continuous monitoring, use the Nova dashboard's log viewer, which handles reconnection transparently.

Log Export Failures:

Exporting large log volumes to files may fail due to memory constraints or disk space. Export in smaller time windows:

nova logs deployment-id --since ""2024-09-01 00:00"" --until ""2024-09-01 06:00"" > logs-part1.txt
nova logs deployment-id --since ""2024-09-01 06:00"" --until ""2024-09-01 12:00"" > logs-part2.txt

Missing Logs:

If logs are unexpectedly missing, verify logging is enabled for your deployment:

nova deploy get deployment-id --format json | jq '.logging.enabled'

Enable logging if disabled:

nova deploy update deployment-id --enable-logging

Log Format Issues:

Corrupted log entries may cause parsing errors. Use the --raw flag to retrieve unparsed logs:

doc-cli_commands-3.1-winner,NovaCLI v3.1 Command Reference,"NovaCLI v3.1 restructured the command hierarchy to improve discoverability and consistency. This guide covers the current command syntax and common usage patterns for the latest stable release.

The v3.0 release introduced a major breaking change: the nova config command was deprecated and replaced with nova settings. This change aligns NovaCLI with industry standards and reduces confusion with configuration file management versus runtime settings management.

All NovaCLI commands follow the pattern: nova [global-flags] <command> <subcommand> [flags] [arguments]

Global flags apply to any command and must appear immediately after nova:

--profile <name>: Use a specific configuration profile
--config <path>: Override default config file location
--verbose: Enable detailed output
--quiet: Suppress non-error messages
--format <json|yaml|table>: Set output format

Core commands in v3.1:

nova settings show: Display current configuration
nova settings set <key> <value>: Modify a configuration value
nova settings reload: Reload configuration from file
nova settings validate: Check configuration syntax

nova deploy start: Initialize a new deployment
nova deploy status: Check deployment progress
nova deploy rollback: Revert to previous version

nova auth login: Authenticate with credentials
nova auth logout: Clear authentication tokens
nova auth whoami: Display current user identity

nova logs tail: Stream real-time logs
nova logs search <query>: Search historical logs
nova logs export --from <date> --to <date>: Export log archive

The nova settings command replaced all functionality previously under nova config. Commands that worked in v2.x no longer function:

DEPRECATED (v2.x): nova config get http://database.host
CURRENT (v3.x): nova settings show http://database.host

DEPRECATED (v2.x): nova config update
CURRENT (v3.x): nova settings reload

Command aliases provide shortcuts for frequent operations:

ns = nova settings
nd = nova deploy
na = nova auth

For detailed help on any command, use: nova <command> --help

doc-configuration-015,Configuration Validation and Testing,"NovaCLI v3.1 provides tools for validating configuration files before deployment, preventing errors and misconfigurations. This guide covers validation commands, testing strategies, and troubleshooting.

Basic Validation:

Validate configuration syntax:

nova config validate config.toml

Checks:
- TOML syntax correctness
- Required fields present
- Type correctness
- Value constraints

Reports errors with line numbers.

Schema Validation:

Validate against strict schema:

nova config validate config.toml --strict

Strict mode:
- Disallows unknown properties
- Enforces recommended settings
- Warns about deprecated options

Dry-Run Deployment:

Test configuration without creating deployment:

nova deploy create --config config.toml --dry-run

Simulates deployment, reports what would happen without making changes.

Configuration Diff:

Compare configurations:

nova config diff config-old.toml config-new.toml

Highlights added, removed, and modified settings.

Compare against running deployment:

nova settings diff <deployment-id> --against config.toml

Identifies configuration drift.

Linting:

Check for common issues and anti-patterns:

nova config lint config.toml

Reports:
- Security concerns (weak settings)
- Performance issues (suboptimal values)
- Style inconsistencies
- Deprecated options

Lint severity levels:
- Error: Must fix
- Warning: Should fix
- Info: Consider fixing

Configuration Testing:

Automated testing for configuration changes:

# http://test-config.sh
nova config validate production.toml
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  nova config lint production.toml
  nova deploy create --config production.toml --dry-run
fi

Integrate into CI/CD pipeline.

Variable Expansion Test:

Verify environment variable substitution:

nova config expand config.toml

Displays configuration with variables expanded, without exposing sensitive values.

Secure mode redacts secrets:

nova config expand config.toml --redact-secrets

Dependency Validation:

Check external dependencies:

nova config check-deps config.toml

Verifies:
- Network connectivity to required services
- DNS resolution for hostnames
- Port availability
- Secret backend accessibility

Constraint Validation:

Enforce organizational policies:

# policy.toml
[constraints]
min_backup_retention_days = 7
required_ssl = true
allowed_regions = [""us-east-1"", ""us-west-2""]

Validate against policy:

nova config validate config.toml --policy policy.toml

Fails if configuration violates policy constraints.

Export Validation Report:

Generate detailed report:

nova config validate config.toml --report validation-report.json

JSON output suitable for parsing by automation tools.

Interactive Validation:

Interactive mode suggests fixes:

nova config validate config.toml --interactive

Prompts to apply suggested fixes automatically.

Configuration Templates:

Start from validated templates:

nova config init --template production

Templates: development, staging, production, high-availability.

Validation Best Practices:

- Validate in CI before merge
- Use strict mode in production
- Test configuration changes in staging first
- Maintain policy file for organizational standards
- Review lint warnings regularly

Troubleshooting Validation Errors:

Common errors:

- Syntax error: Check TOML formatting
- Missing required field: Add required configuration
- Type mismatch: Correct value type
- Invalid value: Check constraints and ranges

doc-getting-started-008,Connecting to Your Deployment,"Once your NovaCLI deployment reaches the active state, you can connect using standard database clients, application frameworks, or the built-in CLI tools. This guide covers connection methods for all supported database engines.

Retrieve connection information:

nova deploy info <deployment-id>

This displays the connection string, hostname, port, database name, username, and initial password. Connection strings are formatted for immediate use with popular tools.

For PostgreSQL deployments, connect using psql:

psql $(nova deploy connection-string <deployment-id>)

Or manually:

psql -h hostname -p 5432 -U username -d database_name

MySQL deployments use mysql client:

mysql -h hostname -P 3306 -u username -p database_name

MongoDB deployments require mongosh:

mongosh $(nova deploy connection-string <deployment-id> --format mongo)

Connection strings include SSL/TLS parameters by default. All NovaCLI deployments enforce encrypted connections. Disable encryption only for testing:

nova deploy info <deployment-id> --insecure-connection

Application frameworks typically need individual parameters rather than connection strings. Extract specific values:

nova deploy info <deployment-id> --output yaml

This provides structured output suitable for environment variables or configuration files.

For Python applications using SQLAlchemy:

from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine(connection_string)

Node.js applications using connection pools:

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: true }
})

Test connectivity:

nova deploy test-connection <deployment-id>

This verifies network reachability, authentication, and SSL certificate validity. If connection fails, check:

- Firewall rules allow outbound connections to the deployment IP
- IP allowlist includes your current IP (check with nova ip-allowlist list)
- Credentials haven't expired

Connection pooling improves performance by reusing database connections. Configure pool size based on your application's concurrency:

nova settings set deployment.<deployment-id>.max_connections 100

doc-troubleshooting-020,Resolving Concurrent Connection Errors,"Connection limit errors prevent new clients from connecting to deployments. Managing connection pools and identifying connection leaks resolves these issues in NovaCLI v3.1.

Error Messages:

Connection limit errors appear as:

- ""Too many connections: limit 100 reached""
- ""Connection refused: max_connections exceeded""
- ""Connection pool exhausted""

Monitoring Connections:

View current connection usage:

nova deploy connections deployment-id

This shows active connections, idle connections, and connection limit.

Increasing Connection Limit:

Raise the maximum connection limit:

nova deploy update deployment-id --max-connections 200

Connection limits are constrained by deployment size. Larger deployments support more connections.

Connection Pooling:

Implement connection pooling in applications to reuse connections:

- Configure pool size: typically 10-20 connections per application instance
- Set max lifetime: recycle connections after 30-60 minutes
- Enable connection validation: test connections before use

Identifying Connection Leaks:

Applications failing to close connections cause leaks. Find long-lived idle connections:

nova deploy connections deployment-id --idle --min-duration 3600

This shows connections idle for over 1 hour. Investigate application code for unclosed connections.

Killing Idle Connections:

Force-close idle connections to free capacity:

nova deploy kill-connection deployment-id connection-id

For bulk termination of idle connections:

nova deploy kill-connections deployment-id --idle --min-duration 1800

Connection Timeout:

Configure idle connection timeout to automatically close stale connections:

nova deploy update deployment-id --idle-connection-timeout 600

Connections idle for 10 minutes are automatically closed.

PgBouncer Integration:

For applications with many short-lived connections, use connection pooling middleware:

nova deploy enable-pgbouncer deployment-id --pool-mode transaction --pool-size 50

PgBouncer pools connections, allowing thousands of client connections while maintaining a small number of database connections.

Monitoring and Alerts:

Alert when approaching connection limits:

doc-api-reference-011,Error Codes and Messages Reference,"The NovaCLI API uses standard HTTP status codes and custom error codes to communicate failures. This reference documents all error codes, their meanings, and recommended client responses.

Error Response Format:

All API errors return consistent JSON structure:

{
  ""status"": ""error"",
  ""error"": {
    ""code"": ""ERROR_CODE"",
    ""message"": ""Human-readable error description"",
    ""details"": {
      ""field"": ""Additional context"",
      ""request_id"": ""req-abc123""
    },
    ""documentation_url"": ""https://docs.novacli.io/errors/ERROR_CODE""
  }
}

Error Handling Best Practices:

1. Always check HTTP status code first
2. Parse error.code for programmatic handling
3. Display error.message to users
4. Log error.details.request_id for support
5. Implement exponential backoff for 429/503
6. Don't retry 4xx errors (except 429)
7. Retry 5xx errors with backoff

Retry Strategy:

Retryable errors: 429, 500, 502, 503, 504
Non-retryable errors: All 4xx except 429

Exponential backoff formula:
wait_time = base_delay  (2  attempt) + jitter

Example (Python):

import time
import random

def api_call_with_retry(func, max_attempts=3):
    for attempt in range(max_attempts):
        try:
            return func()
        except ApiError as e:
            if e.status_code not in [429, 500, 502, 503, 504]:
                raise
            if attempt == max_attempts - 1:
                raise

doc-getting-started-009,Common Getting Started Issues,"New NovaCLI v3.1 users occasionally encounter setup issues during installation, authentication, or first deployment. This guide addresses the most common problems and their solutions.

Installation Issues:

Problem: ""nova: command not found"" after installation.

Solution: The installation directory isn't in your PATH. Add it manually:

For Linux/macOS: echo 'export PATH=""$PATH:/usr/local/bin""' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc

For Windows: Add C:Program FilesNovaCLI to your PATH through System Properties.

Alternatively, reinstall using a package manager which handles PATH configuration automatically.

Problem: Permission denied errors on Linux/macOS.

Solution: The nova binary lacks execute permissions. Fix with:

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/nova

Authentication Issues:

Problem: ""Invalid credentials"" when running nova auth login.

Solution: Verify you're using the correct email and password for your Nova account. If you signed up with OAuth, use the browser-based flow:

nova auth login --browser

Problem: ""Token expired"" errors.

Solution: Authentication tokens expire after 30 days. Re-authenticate:

nova auth login --force

The --force flag replaces the existing token even if it hasn't expired.

Deployment Creation Issues:

Problem: ""Region not available"" error.

Solution: The selected region is at capacity. Choose an alternative region:

nova regions list --available-only

Problem: ""Quota exceeded"" preventing deployment creation.

Solution: Your account has reached its deployment limit. View current usage:

nova quota show

Delete unused deployments or request a quota increase through the web console.

Problem: Deployment stuck in ""provisioning"" state.

Solution: Provisioning typically completes within 5 minutes. If stuck longer:

nova deploy status <deployment-id> --debug

This reveals detailed status messages. Contact support if provisioning exceeds 15 minutes.

Connection Issues:

Problem: Cannot connect to deployment from application.

Solution: Check IP allowlist:

nova ip-allowlist list

Add your IP:

nova ip-allowlist add <your-ip>/32

Problem: SSL certificate verification fails.

doc-api-reference-015,SDK Documentation for Python,"The official NovaCLI Python SDK provides a high-level interface to the NovaCLI API. This reference covers installation, configuration, and common usage patterns for Python developers.

Installation:

Install via pip:

pip install novacli-sdk

Requires Python 3.8 or higher.

Verify installation:

python -c ""import novacli; print(novacli.version)""

Basic Configuration:

Initialize client:

from novacli import Client

client = Client(api_key=""nova_sk_abc123..."")

Alternatively, use environment variable:

export NOVACLI_API_KEY=""nova_sk_abc123...""

from novacli import Client
client = Client()  # Reads from environment

Client configuration options:

client = Client(
    api_key=""nova_sk_abc123..."",
    base_url=""https://api.novacli.io"",
    timeout=30,
    max_retries=3,
    region=""us-east-1""
)

Deployment Operations:

List deployments:

deployments = client.deployments.list(
    status=""active"",
    region=""us-east-1"",
    limit=50
)

for deployment in deployments:
    print(f""{http://deployment.id}: {http://deployment.name}"")

Get deployment:

deployment = client.deployments.get(""dep-abc123"")
print(f""Status: {deployment.status}"")
print(f""Region: {deployment.region}"")

Create deployment:

deployment = client.deployments.create(
    name=""my-deployment"",
    size=""medium"",
    region=""us-east-1"",
    config={
        ""max_connections"": 100,
        ""backup_enabled"": True
    },
    tags={""env"": ""production""}
)

print(f""Created: {http://deployment.id}"")

Update deployment:

deployment = client.deployments.update(
    ""dep-abc123"",
    size=""large"",
    config={""max_connections"": 200}
)

Delete deployment:

client.deployments.delete(""dep-abc123"", force=False)

Backup Operations:

List backups:

backups = client.backups.list(
    deployment_id=""dep-abc123"",
    type=""manual""
)

Create backup:

backup = client.backups.create(
    deployment_id=""dep-abc123"",
    name=""pre-migration"",
    retention_days=90
)

Restore backup:

restore = client.backups.restore(
    deployment_id=""dep-abc123"",
    backup_id=""backup-xyz789"",
    verify_before_restore=True
)

print(f""Restore status: {restore.status}"")

Error Handling:

SDK exceptions:

from novacli import (
    ApiError,
    AuthenticationError,
    NotFoundError,
    RateLimitError
)

try:
    deployment = client.deployments.get(""invalid-id"")
except NotFoundError as e:
    print(f""Deployment not found: {e}"")
except AuthenticationError as e:
    print(f""Authentication failed: {e}"")
except RateLimitError as e:
    print(f""Rate limited. Retry after {e.retry_after}s"")
except ApiError as e:
    print(f""API error: {e.status_code} - {e.message}"")

Pagination:

Automatic pagination:

for deployment in client.deployments.iterate():
    print(http://deployment.name)

Manual pagination:

page = client.deployments.list(limit=50)
while page.has_more:
    for deployment in http://page.data:
        print(http://deployment.name)
    page = client.deployments.list(
        limit=50,
        cursor=http://page.next_cursor
    )

Async Support:

Async client:

from novacli import AsyncClient
import asyncio

async def main():
    async with AsyncClient(api_key=""..."") as client:
        deployments = await client.deployments.list()
        for deployment in deployments:
            print(http://deployment.name)

http://asyncio.run(main())

Streaming Logs:

Stream deployment logs:

for log in http://client.logs.stream(deployment_id=""dep-abc123""):
    print(f""{log.timestamp} [{log.level}] {log.message}"")

Webhooks:

Create webhook:

webhook = client.webhooks.create(
    url=""https://myapp.com/webhook"",
    events=[""deployment.created"", ""deployment.failed""],
    secret=""webhook_secret_123""
)

Verify webhook signature:

import hmac
import hashlib

def verify_webhook(secret, body, signature):
    expected = http://hmac.new(
        secret.encode(),
        body.encode(),
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()
    return http://hmac.compare_digest(
        f""sha256={expected}"",
        signature
    )

SDK Configuration:

Custom timeout:

client = Client(
    api_key=""..."",
    timeout=60,
    connect_timeout=10
)

Proxy support:

client = Client(
    api_key=""..."",
    proxies={
        ""http"": ""http://proxy.company.com:8080"",
        ""https"": ""https://proxy.company.com:8080""
    }
)

doc-configuration-030,GitOps Integration Configuration,"NovaCLI v3.1 supports GitOps workflows for declarative configuration management. This guide covers Git repository integration, automated sync, and drift detection.

GitOps Activation:

Enable GitOps mode:

[gitops]
enabled = true
repository_url = ""https://github.com/company/novacli-config.git""
branch = ""main""
auto_sync = true

Repository Structure:

Organize configurations:

novacli-config/
  environments/
    production/
      deployments/
      configs/
    staging/
      deployments/
      configs/
  templates/
  policies/

Authentication:

Configure Git authentication:

[gitops.auth]
method = ""ssh""  # or ""token"", ""app""
ssh_key_path = ""/etc/nova/ssh/id_rsa""
known_hosts_path = ""/etc/nova/ssh/known_hosts""

For token auth:

[gitops.auth]
method = ""token""
token = ""${GIT_TOKEN}""

Sync Configuration:

Configure sync behavior:

[gitops.sync]
interval = 300  # seconds
auto_prune = true
self_heal = true
retry_limit = 5

Manual sync:

nova gitops sync <deployment-id>

Force sync:

nova gitops sync <deployment-id> --force

Drift Detection:

Detect configuration drift:

[gitops.drift]
detection_enabled = true
check_interval = 600  # seconds
alert_on_drift = true

View drift:

nova gitops diff <deployment-id>

Shows differences between Git and actual state.

Auto-Remediation:

Automatically fix drift:

[gitops.remediation]
auto_remediate = true
remediation_strategy = ""git_wins""  # or ""manual"", ""merge""

Commit Strategy:

Define commit workflow:

[gitops.commits]
require_pull_request = true
auto_commit_interval = 0  # Manual commits only
commit_message_template = ""[novacli] {action} {resource}""

Create PR for changes:

nova deploy update <deployment-id> 
  --size large 
  --gitops-pr ""Increase deployment size""

Branch Strategy:

Manage branches:

[gitops.branches]
production_branch = ""main""
staging_branch = ""staging""
feature_branch_pattern = ""feature/*""

Deploy from branch:

nova deploy create 
  --gitops-branch feature/new-config

Validation:

Validate before apply:

[gitops.validation]
pre_sync_validation = true
schema_validation = true
policy_validation = true

Validation webhook:

[gitops.webhooks]
validation_url = ""https://validator.company.com/validate""
timeout = 30  # seconds

Rollback:

Rollback to previous Git revision:

nova gitops rollback <deployment-id> 
  --to-commit abc123

Automatic rollback:

[gitops.rollback]
auto_rollback_on_failure = true
health_check_timeout = 300

Multi-Environment:

Manage multiple environments:

[gitops.environments]

[[gitops.environments.env]]
name = ""production""
path = ""environments/production""
require_approval = true

[[gitops.environments.env]]
name = ""staging""
path = ""environments/staging""
auto_promote = false

Notifications:

Notify on GitOps events:

[gitops.notifications]
sync_success = [""slack""]
sync_failure = [""slack"", ""pagerduty""]
drift_detected = [""slack""]

Encryption:

Encrypt secrets in Git:

[gitops.encryption]
method = ""sealed_secrets""  # or ""sops"", ""vault""
public_key_path = ""/etc/nova/http://sealing-key.pub""

Seal secret:

nova gitops seal-secret 
  --input secret.yaml 
  --output sealed-secret.yaml

Audit:

Audit GitOps operations:

[gitops.audit]
log_all_operations = true
log_destination = ""elasticsearch""

View GitOps history:

nova gitops history <deployment-id>

Policy Enforcement:

Enforce policies via Git:

[gitops.policy]
enforce_policies = true

doc-troubleshooting-001,Resolving Connection Timeout Errors,"Connection timeout errors are among the most common issues when using NovaCLI v3.1. These errors typically manifest as ""Connection to http://api.nova.io timed out after 30 seconds"" and can stem from network configuration, firewall rules, or API availability.

Common Causes:

Network connectivity issues are the primary cause. Verify your internet connection and ensure your network allows HTTPS traffic on port 443. Corporate networks often restrict outbound connections, requiring firewall rule updates or proxy configuration.

Firewall and Proxy Settings:

If you're behind a corporate firewall, configure NovaCLI to use your proxy:

nova config set proxy.url http://proxy.company.com:8080
nova config set proxy.username your-username

For authentication, the proxy password is stored securely in your system keychain.

DNS Resolution:

DNS issues can cause connection failures. Test DNS resolution:

nslookup http://api.nova.io

If this fails, configure alternative DNS servers (such as 8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1) in your network settings.

API Status:

Verify Nova service availability at http://status.nova.io. Scheduled maintenance or incidents may cause temporary connectivity issues. The status page displays current service health and upcoming maintenance windows.

Timeout Configuration:

Increase timeout values for slow networks:

nova config set network.timeout 60

This sets the connection timeout to 60 seconds instead of the default 30.

SSL Certificate Verification:

Corporate networks using SSL inspection may cause certificate validation errors. If you see ""SSL certificate verification failed,"" your network is likely intercepting HTTPS traffic. Configure NovaCLI to trust your corporate CA certificate:

nova config set http://ssl.ca_bundle /path/to/corporate-ca.pem

Diagnostic Commands:

Run connection diagnostics:

nova debug connection

doc-api-reference-016,SDK Documentation for JavaScript,"The official NovaCLI JavaScript SDK provides a modern, Promise-based interface to the NovaCLI API for Node.js and browser environments. This reference covers installation, configuration, and usage patterns.

Installation:

NPM:
npm install @novacli/sdk

Yarn:
yarn add @novacli/sdk

CDN (browser):
<script src=""https://cdn.novacli.io/sdk/v1/novacli.min.js""></script>

Requires Node.js 16+ or modern browser with ES6 support.

Basic Setup:

CommonJS:
const { NovaCLI } = require('@novacli/sdk');

const client = new NovaCLI({
  apiKey: 'nova_sk_abc123...'
});

ES6 Modules:
import { NovaCLI } from '@novacli/sdk';

const client = new NovaCLI({
  apiKey: process.env.NOVACLI_API_KEY
});

Configuration Options:

const client = new NovaCLI({
  apiKey: 'nova_sk_abc123...',
  baseURL: 'https://api.novacli.io',
  timeout: 30000,
  maxRetries: 3,
  region: 'us-east-1',
  headers: {
    'X-Custom-Header': 'value'
  }
});

Deployments:

List deployments:
const deployments = await client.deployments.list({
  status: 'active',
  region: 'us-east-1',
  limit: 50
});

http://deployments.data.forEach(dep => {
  console.log(${http://dep.id}: ${http://dep.name});
});

Get deployment:
const deployment = await client.deployments.get('dep-abc123');
console.log(Status: ${deployment.status});

Create deployment:
const deployment = await client.deployments.create({
  name: 'my-deployment',
  size: 'medium',
  region: 'us-east-1',
  config: {
    maxConnections: 100,
    backupEnabled: true
  },
  tags: { env: 'production' }
});

Update deployment:
const updated = await client.deployments.update('dep-abc123', {
  size: 'large',
  config: { maxConnections: 200 }
});

Delete deployment:
await client.deployments.delete('dep-abc123', { force: false });

Backups:

List backups:
const backups = await client.backups.list('dep-abc123', {
  type: 'manual'
});

Create backup:
const backup = await client.backups.create('dep-abc123', {
  name: 'pre-migration',
  retentionDays: 90
});

Restore backup:
const restore = await client.backups.restore('dep-abc123', 'backup-xyz789', {
  verifyBeforeRestore: true
});

console.log(Restore status: ${restore.status});

Error Handling:

try {
  const deployment = await client.deployments.get('invalid-id');
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof NovaCLI.NotFoundError) {
    console.error('Deployment not found');
  } else if (error instanceof NovaCLI.AuthenticationError) {
    console.error('Authentication failed');
  } else if (error instanceof NovaCLI.RateLimitError) {
    console.error(Rate limited. Retry after ${error.retryAfter}s);
  } else {
    console.error(API error: ${error.message});
  }
}

Pagination:

Automatic pagination:
for await (const deployment of client.deployments.iterate()) {
  console.log(http://deployment.name);
}

Manual pagination:
let cursor;
do {
  const page = await client.deployments.list({
    limit: 50,
    cursor
  });
  
  http://page.data.forEach(dep => console.log(http://dep.name));
  cursor = page.pagination.nextCursor;
} while (cursor);

Promise Handling:

Promise chains:
client.deployments.list({ status: 'active' })
  .then(deployments => {
    console.log(Found ${http://deployments.data.length} deployments);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error.message);
  });

Async/await:
async function listDeployments() {
  try {
    const deployments = await client.deployments.list();
    return http://deployments.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

Streaming Logs:

Stream deployment logs:
const stream = http://client.logs.stream('dep-abc123');

stream.on('data', log => {
  console.log(${log.timestamp} [${log.level}] ${log.message});
});

stream.on('error', error => {
  console.error('Stream error:', error);
});

stream.on('end', () => {
  console.log('Stream ended');
});

Webhooks:

Create webhook:
const webhook = await client.webhooks.create({
  url: 'https://myapp.com/webhook',
  events: ['deployment.created', 'deployment.failed'],
  secret: 'webhook_secret_123'
});

Verify webhook signature:
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyWebhook(secret, body, signature) {
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret);
  hmac.update(body);
  const expected = sha256=${hmac.digest('hex')};
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(expected),
    Buffer.from(signature)
  );
}

Browser Usage:

Browser configuration:
const client = new NovaCLI({
  apiKey: 'nova_pk_abc123...',  // Public key for browser
  enableCORS: true
});

Note: Use public API keys in browser environments.

Request Cancellation:

AbortController support:
const controller = new AbortController();

const promise = client.deployments.list({
  signal: controller.signal
});

// Cancel request
controller.abort();

Retry Configuration:

Custom retry strategy:
const client = new NovaCLI({
  apiKey: 'nova_sk_abc123...',
  retry: {
    retries: 3,
    retryDelay: attemptCount => Math.pow(2, attemptCount) * 1000,
    retryCondition: error => error.response?.status >= 500
  }
});

Interceptors:

Request interceptor:
client.interceptors.request.use(config => {
  console.log('Making request:', config.url);
  return config;
});

Response interceptor:
client.interceptors.response.use(
  response => {
    console.log('Response received:', response.status);
    return response;
  },
  error => {
    console.error('Request failed:', error.message);
    return Promise.reject(error);

doc-api-reference-027,API Error Codes and Troubleshooting,"The Nova REST API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests. Understanding error codes helps diagnose issues quickly and implement proper error handling in your integrations.

Success Codes:

200 OK: Request succeeded, response body contains requested data
201 Created: Resource created successfully, Location header contains new resource URL
204 No Content: Request succeeded, no response body (typically for delete operations)

Client Error Codes:

400 Bad Request: Invalid request syntax or missing required parameters. Check the error message in the response body for details.

401 Unauthorized: Authentication required or invalid credentials. Verify your API token with nova auth status.

403 Forbidden: Valid authentication but insufficient permissions. Check your account role and resource permissions.

404 Not Found: Resource does not exist. Verify the resource ID and ensure it hasn't been deleted.

409 Conflict: Request conflicts with current resource state. Common when attempting to create a duplicate resource or modify a resource that has been updated by another client.

422 Unprocessable Entity: Request is syntactically correct but semantically invalid. Review field validation requirements in the API documentation.

429 Too Many Requests: Rate limit exceeded. Check X-RateLimit-Reset header and implement exponential backoff.

Server Error Codes:

500 Internal Server Error: Unexpected server error. Retry the request with exponential backoff. If the issue persists, contact support with the X-Request-ID from the response headers.

503 Service Unavailable: Temporary service disruption or scheduled maintenance. Check http://status.nova.io for service status and retry after a delay.

Error Response Format:

All error responses include a JSON body with detailed information:

doc-configuration-010,Secrets Management Integration,"NovaCLI v3.1 integrates with external secrets management systems to avoid storing sensitive values in configuration files. This guide covers integration with HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, and Azure Key Vault.

Secrets Management Benefits:

- Centralized secret storage
- Audit logging of secret access
- Automatic rotation
- Fine-grained access control
- Encryption at rest and in transit

HashiCorp Vault Integration:

Configure Vault connection:

[secrets.vault]
address = ""https://vault.company.com:8200""
auth_method = ""token""  # or ""kubernetes"", ""aws""
token = ""${VAULT_TOKEN}""
namespace = ""admin""

Reference secrets in configuration:

[database]
password = ""vault://secret/data/database#password""

[api]
api_key = ""vault://secret/data/api#key""

NovaCLI fetches secrets at runtime. Secrets never written to disk.

AWS Secrets Manager:

Configure AWS Secrets Manager:

[http://secrets.aws]
region = ""us-east-1""
auth_method = ""iam""  # Uses IAM role

Reference secrets:

[database]
password = ""aws-secretsmanager://prod/database/password""

Requires IAM permissions:

{
  ""Effect"": ""Allow"",
  ""Action"": [
    ""secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"",
    ""secretsmanager:DescribeSecret""
  ],
  ""Resource"": ""arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:prod/*""
}

Azure Key Vault:

Configure Azure Key Vault:

[http://secrets.azure]
vault_url = ""https://myvault.vault.azure.net""
auth_method = ""managed_identity""
tenant_id = ""${AZURE_TENANT_ID}""

Reference secrets:

[database]
password = ""azure-keyvault://database-password""

Secret Caching:

Cache secrets to reduce latency:

[secrets]
cache_enabled = true
cache_ttl = 3600  # seconds

Balances performance against secret freshness. Shorter TTL means more frequent fetches.

Secret Rotation:

Automatic rotation integration:

[secrets.rotation]
auto_reload = true
reload_interval = 300  # seconds

Periodically checks for updated secrets, reloads without restart.

Fallback Configuration:

Provide fallback if secrets backend unavailable:

[secrets]
fallback_mode = ""error""  # or ""env"", ""file""

Error mode fails immediately. Env mode falls back to environment variables. File mode reads from encrypted local file.

Secret Templates:

Compose secrets from multiple sources:

[database]
connection_string = ""postgres://${secrets:vault://user}:${secrets:vault://password}@${http://database.host}:5432/${http://database.name}""

Supports mixing secrets with configuration values.

Audit Logging:

Log secret access:

[secrets.audit]
log_access = true
log_destination = ""syslog""

Compliance requirement for many organizations.

Local Development:

Use environment variables during development:

export DATABASE_PASSWORD=""devpassword""

[database]
password = ""${DATABASE_PASSWORD}""

Automatic promotion to secrets manager in production.

Troubleshooting:

Test secrets connectivity:

doc-getting-started-011,Using NovaCLI with Docker,"NovaCLI v3.1 provides an official Docker image for containerized environments, making it easy to integrate into CI/CD pipelines and development workflows without local installation.

Pull the official image from Docker Hub:

docker pull nova/cli:3.1

The image is based on Alpine Linux and includes only NovaCLI and its dependencies, resulting in a compact 45MB compressed size.

Run commands directly:

docker run --rm nova/cli:3.1 nova --version

For interactive sessions:

docker run -it --rm nova/cli:3.1 sh

This drops you into a shell with nova available in the PATH.

Authentication in containers requires passing credentials securely. Mount your credentials as a volume:

docker run --rm -v ~/.novacli:/root/.novacli nova/cli:3.1 nova auth whoami

Alternatively, use environment variables:

docker run --rm -e NOVA_API_TOKEN=$NOVA_API_TOKEN nova/cli:3.1 nova deploy list

For CI/CD pipelines, store tokens in secure secret managers and inject them at runtime. Never embed tokens in Dockerfiles or commit them to version control.

GitHub Actions example:

- name: Deploy with NovaCLI
  run: docker run --rm -e NOVA_API_TOKEN=$ secrets.NOVA_TOKEN  nova/cli:3.1 nova deploy create --name ci-build-$ http://github.run_number 

GitLab CI example:

deploy:
  image: nova/cli:3.1
  script:
    - nova deploy create --name $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME
  only:
    - main

For development, create a custom image extending the base:

FROM nova/cli:3.1
COPY scripts/ /scripts/
WORKDIR /scripts
CMD [""./http://deploy.sh""]

The official image supports multiple architectures: amd64, arm64, and armv7. Docker automatically pulls the appropriate variant for your platform.

Version pinning ensures reproducible builds:

docker run nova/cli:3.1.2

Use specific version tags rather than :latest in production.

Multi-stage builds optimize image size for custom tooling:

FROM nova/cli:3.1 as nova
FROM alpine:3.18

doc-api-reference-017,GraphQL API Reference,"NovaCLI provides a GraphQL API as an alternative to REST for flexible data querying. This reference covers the GraphQL schema, query patterns, and best practices.

GraphQL Endpoint:

Single endpoint for all operations:

POST https://api.novacli.io/graphql

Authentication via header:
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

GraphQL Playground:

Interactive explorer:
https://api.novacli.io/graphql/playground

Schema Introspection:

Query schema:
query IntrospectionQuery {
  __schema {
    queryType { name }
    mutationType { name }
    types {
      name
      kind
      description
    }
  }
}

Basic Queries:

List deployments:
query {
  deployments(status: ACTIVE, limit: 10) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        status
        region
        createdAt
      }
    }
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
      endCursor
    }
  }
}

Get single deployment:
query {
  deployment(id: ""dep-abc123"") {
    id
    name
    status
    region
    size
    config {
      maxConnections
      backupEnabled
    }
    metrics {
      cpu
      memory
      connections
    }
  }
}

Nested Queries:

Deployment with backups:
query {
  deployment(id: ""dep-abc123"") {
    id
    name
    backups(type: MANUAL, first: 5) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          createdAt
          sizeBytes
          status
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

Mutations:

Create deployment:
mutation {
  createDeployment(input: {
    name: ""my-deployment""
    size: MEDIUM
    region: US_EAST_1
    config: {
      maxConnections: 100
      backupEnabled: true
    }
  }) {
    deployment {
      id
      name
      status
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}

Update deployment:
mutation {
  updateDeployment(input: {
    id: ""dep-abc123""
    size: LARGE
    config: {
      maxConnections: 200
    }
  }) {
    deployment {
      id
      size
      config {
        maxConnections
      }
    }
  }
}

Delete deployment:
mutation {
  deleteDeployment(input: {
    id: ""dep-abc123""
    force: false
  }) {
    success
    message
  }
}

Fragments:

Reusable fragments:
fragment DeploymentDetails on Deployment {
  id
  name
  status
  region
  size
  createdAt
}

query {
  deployment(id: ""dep-abc123"") {
    ...DeploymentDetails
    config {
      maxConnections
    }
  }
}

Variables:

Parameterized queries:
query GetDeployment($id: ID!) {
  deployment(id: $id) {
    id
    name
    status
  }
}

Variables:
{
  ""id"": ""dep-abc123""
}

Pagination:

Cursor-based pagination:
query {
  deployments(first: 10, after: ""cursor123"") {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
      }
      cursor
    }
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
      hasPreviousPage
      startCursor
      endCursor
    }
    totalCount
  }
}

Filtering:

Complex filters:
query {
  deployments(
    filter: {
      status: { in: [ACTIVE, STOPPED] }
      region: { eq: US_EAST_1 }
      createdAt: { gte: ""2024-09-01"" }
    }
    orderBy: { field: CREATED_AT, direction: DESC }
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}

Subscriptions:

Real-time updates:
subscription {
  deploymentUpdated(id: ""dep-abc123"") {
    id
    status
    metrics {
      cpu
      memory
    }
  }
}

WebSocket connection required for subscriptions.

Error Handling:

GraphQL errors:
{
  ""errors"": [
    {
      ""message"": ""Deployment not found"",
      ""locations"": [{""line"": 2, ""column"": 3}],
      ""path"": [""deployment""],
      ""extensions"": {
        ""code"": ""NOT_FOUND"",
        ""deploymentId"": ""dep-invalid""
      }
    }
  ],
  ""data"": null
}

Batching:

Batch multiple queries:
query {
  dep1: deployment(id: ""dep-abc123"") {
    id
    name
  }
  dep2: deployment(id: ""dep-xyz789"") {
    id
    name
  }
}

Single request returns both deployments.

Field Selection:

Request only needed fields:
query {
  deployments {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}

Reduces payload size and improves performance.

Type System:

Enum types:
enum DeploymentStatus {
  CREATING
  ACTIVE
  STOPPED
  FAILED
  DELETED
}

Enum values used in queries and mutations.

Scalar types:
- ID: Unique identifier
- String: Text
- Int: Integer
- Float: Decimal
- Boolean: true/false
- DateTime: ISO 8601 timestamp

Query Complexity:

Complexity limits prevent expensive queries:
- Maximum depth: 10 levels
- Maximum complexity: 1000 points
- List limits: 100 items per field

Exceeding limits returns error:
{
  ""errors"": [{
    ""message"": ""Query complexity exceeds maximum"",
    ""extensions"": {
      ""code"": ""QUERY_TOO_COMPLEX"",
      ""complexity"": 1250,
      ""maximum"": 1000
    }

doc-configuration-026,Disaster Recovery Configuration,"NovaCLI v3.1 provides comprehensive disaster recovery capabilities to ensure business continuity. This guide covers DR planning, configuration, and testing.

DR Strategy:

Define disaster recovery strategy:

[disaster_recovery]
strategy = ""hot_standby""  # or ""warm_standby"", ""cold_backup""
rpo_minutes = 15  # Recovery Point Objective
rto_minutes = 60  # Recovery Time Objective

Hot standby: Active-passive with synchronous replication
Warm standby: Standby with periodic sync
Cold backup: Restore from backups only

DR Site Configuration:

Configure secondary site:

[disaster_recovery.secondary_site]
region = ""us-west-2""
replication_enabled = true
replication_mode = ""asynchronous""  # or ""synchronous""
lag_threshold_seconds = 30

Replication Monitoring:

Monitor replication health:

[disaster_recovery.monitoring]
health_check_interval = 10  # seconds
lag_alert_threshold = 60
failure_detection_time = 30

View replication status:

nova dr status <deployment-id>

Displays replication lag, health, and last sync time.

Failover Configuration:

Configure automatic or manual failover:

[disaster_recovery.failover]
auto_failover = false  # Manual approval required
failover_timeout = 300  # seconds
require_approval = true
approvers = [""mailto:oncall@company.com""]

Initiate failover:

nova dr failover <deployment-id> 
  --to-region us-west-2 
  --reason ""Primary region outage""

Failback Procedure:

Return to primary site:

nova dr failback <deployment-id> 
  --to-region us-east-1 
  --sync-mode full

Sync modes:
- full: Complete data synchronization
- incremental: Only changes since failover
- verify: Validate before failback

Data Replication:

Configure replication scope:

[disaster_recovery.replication]
replicate_data = true
replicate_config = true
replicate_secrets = false  # Manage separately
exclude_tables = [""temp_data"", ""cache""]

Backup Integration:

Integrate with backup system:

[disaster_recovery.backup]
continuous_backup = true
backup_frequency = 15  # minutes
cross_region_backup = true
backup_encryption = true

DR Testing:

Schedule DR drills:

[disaster_recovery.testing]
scheduled_drills = true
drill_frequency_days = 90
auto_verify = true
notify_team = true

Run DR test:

nova dr test <deployment-id> 
  --type failover 
  --duration 3600

Test without affecting production.

Split-Brain Prevention:

Prevent split-brain scenarios:

[disaster_recovery.split_brain]
prevention_enabled = true
quorum_size = 3
fencing_enabled = true

Network Partitioning:

Handle network partitions:

[disaster_http://recovery.network]
partition_detection = true
prefer_primary = true
auto_reconnect = true
reconnect_delay = 10  # seconds

Data Consistency:

Ensure consistency during failover:

[disaster_recovery.consistency]
mode = ""strong""  # or ""eventual""
validation_enabled = true
conflict_resolution = ""primary_wins""

DR Runbook:

Generate DR runbook:

nova dr runbook <deployment-id> 
  --output runbook.pdf

Incudes step-by-step failover procedures.

Notifications:

Notify during DR events:

[disaster_recovery.notifications]
failover_channels = [""pagerduty"", ""slack"", ""email""]
test_channels = [""slack""]
include_metrics = true

DR Metrics:

Track DR performance:

[disaster_recovery.metrics]
rpo_actual = true
rto_actual = true
failover_count = true
replication_lag = true

Audit DR events:

nova dr audit --days 30

Cost Optimization:

Optimize DR costs:

[disaster_recovery.cost]
standby_size = ""medium""  # Smaller than primary

doc-getting-started-012,NovaCLI Shell Completion,"NovaCLI v3.1 provides shell completion for Bash, Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell, enabling faster command entry and discovery through tab completion.

Shell completion suggests commands, subcommands, flags, and in some cases, dynamic values like deployment IDs and region names. This reduces the need to reference documentation during interactive use.

For Bash, add completion to your shell configuration:

echo 'source <(nova completion bash)' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

Alternatively, for system-wide installation:

nova completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/nova

For Zsh users:

echo 'source <(nova completion zsh)' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

If you encounter errors about completion functions not found, ensure compinit is initialized:

autoload -Uz compinit
compinit

For Fish shell:

nova completion fish | source

Make it permanent:

nova completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/http://nova.fish

For PowerShell on Windows:

nova completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression

Add to your profile for persistence:

nova completion powershell >> $PROFILE

Verify completion works by typing nova and pressing Tab. You should see available commands like auth, deploy, settings, logs.

Completion for subcommands:

nova deploy <Tab>

Displays: create, delete, info, list, rollback, start, status, stop, update

Flag completion:

nova deploy create --<Tab>

Shows all available flags: --name, --region, --size, --env, --engine, --ha-mode

Dynamic value completion requires authentication. Once authenticated, completion suggests real values:

nova deploy info <Tab>

Suggests your actual deployment IDs from the API.

nova deploy create --region <Tab>

Suggests available regions: us-east-1, us-west-1, eu-central-1, etc.

Completion scripts are generated from command metadata, ensuring they stay synchronized with available commands as NovaCLI evolves.

For custom aliases, completion still works:

alias nd='nova deploy'
nd <Tab>  # Still completes subcommands

Some shells require additional configuration for alias completion. Consult your shell's documentation for details.

doc-troubleshooting-021,Understanding Maintenance Window Behavior,"Maintenance windows allow scheduled operations to run during off-peak hours. Understanding maintenance behavior helps plan around potential service interruptions in NovaCLI v3.1.

Automatic Maintenance:

Nova schedules automatic maintenance for critical updates:

- Security patches: applied within 48 hours of release
- Minor version updates: scheduled based on account preferences
- Infrastructure maintenance: announced 7 days in advance

Configuring Maintenance Windows:

Set preferred maintenance windows:

nova deploy set-maintenance-window deployment-id --day sunday --time ""02:00-06:00""

Maintenance operations will be scheduled during this window when possible.

Maintenance Notifications:

Nova sends notifications before scheduled maintenance:

- 7 days before: email notification for infrastructure maintenance
- 24 hours before: dashboard notification for minor updates
- 1 hour before: API notification and deployment status change

Check upcoming maintenance:

nova deploy maintenance deployment-id

This lists scheduled maintenance with dates, expected duration, and impact description.

Deferring Maintenance:

Defer non-critical maintenance by up to 14 days:

nova deploy defer-maintenance deployment-id maintenance-id --days 7

Critical security patches cannot be deferred.

Maintenance Impact:

Different maintenance types have varying impact:

- Rolling updates: no downtime, temporary performance impact
- Minor version upgrades: 2-5 minute connection interruption
- Infrastructure maintenance: potential 10-15 minute downtime

During Maintenance:

Deployment behavior during maintenance:

- Read operations: generally available during rolling updates
- Write operations: may be temporarily blocked
- New connections: may be rejected during brief windows
- Existing connections: gracefully terminated with warnings

Post-Maintenance Validation:

After maintenance completes, verify deployment health:

nova deploy health deployment-id

Check for any warnings or issues introduced by maintenance.

Emergency Maintenance:

doc-getting-started-013,Hello World Deployment,"This tutorial creates a minimal ""Hello World"" deployment to verify your NovaCLI v3.1 setup works correctly. The entire process takes about 5 minutes.

Before starting, verify authentication:

nova auth whoami

You should see your username. If not, run nova auth login first.

Create a minimal deployment:

nova deploy create 
  --name hello-world 
  --region us-east-1 
  --size small 
  --env development 
  --engine postgresql-15

NovaCLI displays the deployment ID immediately. Save this ID; you'll need it for subsequent commands.

Small instances are perfect for testing. They cost minimal amounts and provision quickly. Development environments skip some production validations, further speeding provisioning.

Monitor progress:

nova deploy status <deployment-id> --watch

The --watch flag updates status every 5 seconds. Status progresses: queued → provisioning → configuring → starting → active.

Provisioning typically completes in 3-4 minutes for small instances in development mode.

Once active, retrieve connection info:

nova deploy info <deployment-id>

Copy the connection string displayed. It includes hostname, port, database name, username, and password.

Test connectivity using psql (install PostgreSQL client if needed):

psql ""<connection-string>""

You're now connected to your deployment. Create a test table:

CREATE TABLE greetings (message TEXT);
INSERT INTO greetings VALUES ('Hello, World!');
SELECT * FROM greetings;

You should see your greeting returned.

Exit psql:

q

View deployment logs:

nova logs tail <deployment-id> --lines 50

Logs show the CREATE TABLE and INSERT commands you executed.

Check deployment metrics:

nova deploy stats <deployment-id>

Displays CPU usage, memory, disk, and connection count.

When finished testing, delete the deployment to avoid charges:

nova deploy delete <deployment-id> --confirm

Deletion is immediate and irreversible. All data is permanently lost.

Verify deletion:

nova deploy list

Your hello-world deployment should no longer appear.

doc-troubleshooting-011,Memory Leak Diagnosis and Resolution,"Memory leaks in NovaCLI deployments cause gradual performance degradation and eventual crashes. Identifying and resolving memory leaks requires monitoring, profiling, and sometimes application code changes.

Symptoms of Memory Leaks:

Memory leaks manifest as:

- Steadily increasing memory usage over time
- Out-of-memory errors after extended runtime
- Performance degradation correlating with uptime
- Frequent deployment restarts to reclaim memory

Monitoring Memory Usage:

Track memory consumption over time:

nova deploy stats deployment-id --metric memory --duration 7d

This graphs memory usage for the past week. A linear upward trend indicates a potential leak.

Identifying Leak Sources:

NovaCLI v3.1 provides memory profiling tools:

nova deploy profile deployment-id --type memory --duration 300

This samples memory allocations for 5 minutes and reports the top memory consumers. Look for unexpected growth in specific components.

Common Leak Causes:

Typical memory leak sources include:

- Unclosed database connections
- Cached data without eviction policies
- Event listeners that are never removed
- Large result sets held in memory
- Circular references preventing garbage collection

Connection Pool Leaks:

Connection leaks are among the most common causes. Monitor active connections:

nova deploy connections deployment-id

If connection count steadily increases, your application isn't properly closing connections. Review connection handling code and ensure all connections are closed in finally blocks or using context managers.

Cache Configuration:

Unbounded caches consume memory indefinitely. Configure cache size limits:

nova deploy update deployment-id --cache-max-size 1024

This limits cache to 1GB. Implement LRU or TTL eviction policies to prevent unbounded growth.

Garbage Collection Tuning:

For managed runtime environments, tune garbage collection:

nova deploy update deployment-id --gc-strategy aggressive

Aggressive GC trades CPU for memory efficiency, running collection more frequently.

Temporary Mitigation:

While investigating root causes, schedule regular restarts to prevent crashes:

doc-api-reference-019,API Security Best Practices,"Secure API usage is critical for protecting deployments and data. This reference covers authentication security, API key management, and secure integration patterns for the NovaCLI API.

API Key Security:

Key storage:
- NEVER commit API keys to version control
- Store in environment variables or secret managers
- Use .env files (add to .gitignore)
- Rotate keys regularly (every 90 days recommended)

Good:
export NOVACLI_API_KEY=""nova_sk_abc123...""

Bad:
const apiKey = ""nova_sk_abc123...""  // Hardcoded!

Secret management services:
- AWS Secrets Manager
- HashiCorp Vault
- Azure Key Vault
- Google Secret Manager

Key Types:

Secret keys (server-side):
- Prefix: nova_sk_
- Full access based on scopes
- MUST be kept confidential
- Use in backend services only

Public keys (client-side):
- Prefix: nova_pk_
- Limited read-only access
- Safe for browser/mobile apps
- Restricted to specific domains

Scope-Based Access:

Principle of least privilege:
- Request minimum required scopes
- Create separate keys per use case
- Use read-only keys when possible

Examples:

CI/CD pipeline key:
Scopes: deployments:write, backups:read

Monitoring dashboard key:
Scopes: metrics:read, logs:read

Automated backup key:
Scopes: backups:create, backups:read

IP Restrictions:

Restrict keys to known IPs:

nova api-key create 
  --name ""production-api"" 
  --allowed-ips ""203.0.113.0/24,198.51.100.42""

Update IP restrictions:

nova api-key update key-abc123 
  --allowed-ips ""10.0.0.0/8""

HTTPS Only:

Always use HTTPS:
- Default: https://api.novacli.io
- Never use HTTP for API calls
- Validate SSL certificates
- Don't disable certificate verification

Bad:
curl --insecure http://api.novacli.io  // NEVER DO THIS

Good:
curl https://api.novacli.io

Webhook Security:

Verify webhook signatures:

import hmac
import hashlib

def verify_webhook(secret, body, signature):
    expected = http://hmac.new(
        secret.encode(),
        body.encode(),
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()
    
    return http://hmac.compare_digest(
        f""sha256={expected}"",
        signature
    )

Use timing-safe comparison to prevent timing attacks.

Store webhook secrets securely:
- Use environment variables
- Rotate webhook secrets periodically
- Use unique secrets per webhook

Rate Limit Handling:

Respect rate limits:
- Monitor X-RateLimit-Remaining header
- Implement exponential backoff
- Cache responses when appropriate
- Use webhooks instead of polling

Example:

import time
import random

def api_call_with_backoff(func, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return func()
        except RateLimitError as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            
            wait = (2  attempt) + random.uniform(0, 1)
            time.sleep(wait)

Error Information:

Don't expose sensitive errors:

Bad:
return {""error"": str(exception)}  // May leak internals

Good:
if isinstance(exception, AuthenticationError):
    return {""error"": ""Authentication failed""}
else:
    log_error(exception)  // Log details server-side
    return {""error"": ""An error occurred""}

Log request_id for debugging:

try:
    result = api_call()
except ApiError as e:
    logger.error(f""API error {e.request_id}: {e.message}"")
    raise

Token Expiration:

Handle token expiration:

Set expiration dates:
nova api-key create --expires 2025-12-31

Monitor expiration:
nova api-key list --filter expires_soon

Automatic renewal:
- Implement automated key rotation
- Store old key during transition
- Update all services before revoking old key

OAuth Security:

OAuth best practices:
- Use state parameter for CSRF protection
- Validate redirect URIs
- Store tokens securely
- Refresh tokens before expiration
- Revoke tokens on logout

Example OAuth flow:

state = generate_random_string()
store_state_in_session(state)

auth_url = build_auth_url(
    client_id=CLIENT_ID,
    redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI,
    scope=""deployments:read"",
    state=state
)

redirect(auth_url)

Audit Logging:

Enable audit logging:

nova settings set audit_logging true

Review audit logs:

nova audit logs --days 30 --filter api_key_usage

Monitor for:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Access from unexpected IPs
- Privilege escalation attempts

Network Security:

Use private networks when possible:
- VPC peering for AWS
- Private Service Connect for GCP
- Private Link for Azure

Firewall rules:
- Whitelist NovaCLI API IPs
- Block outbound to untrusted destinations
- Use egress proxies for auditing

Compliance:

Regulatory compliance:
- SOC 2
- GDPR
- HIPAA
- PCI DSS

Enable compliance mode:

nova settings set compliance_mode strict

Data residency:
- Choose appropriate region
- Enable encryption at rest
- Configure data retention policies

Incident Response:

Revoke compromised keys immediately:

nova api-key revoke key-abc123 --reason ""Suspected compromise""

Rotate affected credentials:

nova api-key rotate-all --filter compromised

doc-api-reference-028,Pagination and Filtering in List Endpoints,"NovaCLI v3.1 API provides list endpoints for resources like deployments, logs, and backups. Understanding pagination and filtering helps you efficiently retrieve large datasets without overwhelming the API or your application.

Pagination:

All list endpoints use cursor-based pagination to ensure consistent results even when data changes:

GET /api/v3/deployments?limit=50&cursor=eyJpZCI6MTIzNH0

The response includes a next_cursor field when more results are available:

{""data"": [...], ""next_cursor"": ""eyJpZCI6MTI4NH0"", ""has_more"": true}

To retrieve the next page, pass the next_cursor value as the cursor parameter in your next request. The default page size is 50 items, maximum is 100.

Filtering:

List endpoints support filtering by common fields:

GET /api/v3/deployments?status=running&region=us-east
GET /api/v3/logs?level=error&since=2024-09-01T00:00:00Z

Multiple filter values for the same field use comma separation:

GET /api/v3/deployments?status=running,pending

Sorting:

Specify sort order with the sort parameter:

GET /api/v3/deployments?sort=created_at:desc
GET /api/v3/backups?sort=size:asc

Available sort fields vary by endpoint. Check the API reference for supported fields.

Field Selection:

Reduce response size by requesting only needed fields:

GET /api/v3/deployments?fields=id,name,status

This returns minimal objects containing only the specified fields, improving performance for large lists.

Date Range Filters:

Many endpoints support date range filtering:

GET /api/v3/logs?since=2024-09-01T00:00:00Z&until=2024-09-07T23:59:59Z

Dates must be in ISO 8601 format with timezone information.

Combining Filters:

All filtering options can be combined:

GET /api/v3/deployments?status=running&region=us-east&sort=created_at:desc&limit=25&fields=id,name

Performance Tips:

doc-configuration-016,Audit Logging Configuration,"NovaCLI v3.1 provides comprehensive audit logging capabilities to track configuration changes, access patterns, and administrative actions. This guide covers audit log configuration, retention, and analysis.

Enabling Audit Logs:

Activate audit logging:

[audit]
enabled = true
log_level = ""detailed""  # or ""basic"", ""verbose""
log_destination = ""file""  # or ""syslog"", ""database""

Detailed level logs all administrative actions. Verbose includes read operations.

Log File Configuration:

Configure file-based audit logging:

[audit.file]
path = ""/var/log/nova/audit.log""
max_size_mb = 100
max_files = 10
compress_rotated = true

Rotates logs when reaching size limit. Compressed archives reduce storage.

Syslog Integration:

Send audit logs to syslog:

[audit.syslog]
address = ""http://syslog.company.com:514""
protocol = ""tcp""
facility = ""local0""
severity = ""info""

Centralized logging simplifies compliance auditing.

Database Logging:

Store audit logs in database:

[audit.database]
connection_string = ""postgres://audituser:${AUDIT_DB_PASSWORD}@auditdb:5432/audit""
table_name = ""nova_audit_log""

Enables SQL queries for audit analysis.

Logged Events:

Configure which events are logged:

[http://audit.events]
login_attempts = true
configuration_changes = true
deployment_lifecycle = true
user_management = true
api_calls = true

Customize based on compliance requirements.

Event Filtering:

Exclude routine events:

[audit.filters]
exclude_users = [""monitoring-bot"", ""health-checker""]
exclude_events = [""health_check"", ""metrics_scrape""]

Reduces log volume from automated systems.

Sensitive Data Redaction:

Redact sensitive information:

[audit.redaction]
redact_passwords = true
redact_tokens = true
redact_patterns = [""api_key=."", ""secret=.""]

Prevents credentials from appearing in logs.

Log Enrichment:

Add contextual information:

[audit.enrichment]
include_ip_address = true
include_user_agent = true
include_session_id = true
include_request_id = true

Facilitates correlation across multiple logs.

Tamper Protection:

Protect audit logs from modification:

[audit.integrity]
sign_entries = true
signing_key = ""${AUDIT_SIGNING_KEY}""
verify_on_read = true

Cryptographic signatures detect tampering.

Retention Policies:

Configure audit log retention:

[audit.retention]
days = 365
archive_after_days = 90
archive_destination = ""s3://audit-archives/""

Long retention supports compliance requirements.

Query and Analysis:

Search audit logs:

nova audit search --user alice --event deployment_created --since 2024-09-01

Filter by user, event type, date range.

Generate reports:

nova audit report --type compliance --period monthly --output report.pdf

Pre-built report templates for common compliance needs.

Real-Time Alerting:

Alert on suspicious activity:

[audit.alerts]
failed_login_threshold = 5
alert_on_privilege_escalation = true
alert_on_bulk_deletion = true
alert_channels = [""email"", ""slack""]

Immediate notification of security-relevant events.

Compliance Frameworks:

Map to compliance requirements:

[audit.compliance]
frameworks = [""SOC2"", ""HIPAA"", ""PCI-DSS""]

doc-env_vars-3.1-winner,Environment Variables in NovaCLI v3.1,"NovaCLI v3.1 supports environment variable configuration for containerized deployments and CI/CD pipelines where configuration files are impractical. This guide covers the environment variable naming convention, precedence rules, and best practices for production use.

Environment variables provide an alternative to TOML configuration files, particularly useful in twelve-factor applications and cloud-native deployments. Variables override file-based configuration, allowing environment-specific customization without modifying base configuration files.

NovaCLI uses the NOVA_ prefix for all environment variables to prevent namespace collisions with other tools. Variable names follow the pattern: NOVA_SECTION_KEY where SECTION matches the TOML section and KEY matches the configuration key.

Configuration file equivalent and environment variable mapping:

[server]
host = ""http://api.nova.io""
port = 443

Environment variables:
NOVA_SERVER_HOST=""http://api.nova.io""
NOVA_SERVER_PORT=443

For nested configuration sections, use double underscores:

[logging.fields]
service = ""novacli""
environment = ""production""

Environment variables:
NOVA_LOGGING_FIELDS_SERVICE=""novacli""
NOVA_LOGGING_FIELDS_ENVIRONMENT=""production""

Boolean values accept multiple formats for compatibility: true/false, 1/0, yes/no, on/off. String values containing spaces or special characters should be quoted.

Precedence rules determine which configuration source wins when multiple sources define the same setting:

1. Command-line flags (highest priority)
2. Environment variables
3. Configuration file values
4. Default values (lowest priority)

This precedence enables flexible deployment patterns where base configuration lives in files, environment-specific overrides use environment variables, and temporary overrides use command-line flags.

Common environment variables for production:

NOVA_SERVER_HOST: API endpoint URL
NOVA_SERVER_PORT: API port number
NOVA_AUTH_TOKEN: Authentication token
NOVA_LOGGING_LEVEL: Log verbosity (debug, info, warn, error)
NOVA_LOGGING_FORMAT: Output format (json, text)
NOVA_LOGGING_OUTPUT: Log destination path

Security considerations: Never log environment variable values in plain text, as they often contain credentials. NovaCLI automatically redacts variables matching TOKEN, SECRET, PASSWORD, KEY patterns in debug output.

To view current configuration including environment variable overrides:

doc-getting-started-016,Uninstalling NovaCLI,"If you need to remove NovaCLI from your system, the uninstallation process varies by platform and installation method. This guide covers complete removal including configuration files and cached data.

For Linux systems installed via package manager:

Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt remove novacli
sudo apt purge novacli  # Also removes config files

CentOS/Fedora:
sudo dnf remove novacli

Arch Linux:
yay -R novacli

For manual binary installations on Linux:

sudo rm /usr/local/bin/nova
rm -rf ~/.novacli

The second command removes your local configuration directory including authentication tokens and settings.

For macOS installed via Homebrew:

brew uninstall novacli
rm -rf ~/.novacli

For macOS DMG installations:

Drag NovaCLI from Applications to Trash, then:

rm /usr/local/bin/nova
rm -rf ~/.novacli

For Windows MSI installations:

Uninstall through Settings > Apps > Apps & features, locate NovaCLI, click Uninstall.

Manually remove configuration:

rd /s /q %USERPROFILE%.novacli

For Windows installed via winget:

winget uninstall Nova.CLI

For Chocolatey:

choco uninstall novacli

Verify complete removal:

nova --version

Should display ""command not found"" or equivalent error.

Removing shell completions:

Bash:
rm /etc/bash_completion.d/nova

Zsh:
Remove the nova completion line from ~/.zshrc

Fish:
rm ~/.config/fish/completions/http://nova.fish

PowerShell:
Remove the nova completion line from your PowerShell profile.

Before uninstalling, consider backing up your configuration if you might reinstall later:

cp -r ~/.novacli ~/novacli-backup

Or export specific settings:

nova settings export --output my-settings.toml

Delete any active deployments before uninstalling to avoid orphaned resources that continue incurring charges:

nova deploy list
nova deploy delete <deployment-id> --confirm

Revoke authentication tokens through the web console under Settings > API Tokens for additional security.

Docker users can simply remove the container images:

docker rmi nova/cli:3.1

No additional cleanup is needed for containerized usage unless you mounted configuration volumes.

doc-api-reference-021,Batch Operations API Guide,"The NovaCLI API supports batch operations for efficient bulk resource management. This reference covers batch endpoints, parallel processing, and error handling for bulk operations.

Batch Create Deployments:

Create multiple deployments in single request:

POST /batch/deployments

Request body:

{
  ""operations"": [
    {
      ""name"": ""deploy-1"",
      ""size"": ""small"",
      ""region"": ""us-east-1""
    },
    {
      ""name"": ""deploy-2"",
      ""size"": ""medium"",
      ""region"": ""eu-west-1""
    },
    {
      ""name"": ""deploy-3"",
      ""size"": ""large"",
      ""region"": ""ap-southeast-1""
    }
  ],
  ""parallel"": true,
  ""fail_on_error"": false
}

Response includes results for each operation:

{
  ""status"": ""partial_success"",
  ""results"": [
    {
      ""index"": 0,
      ""status"": ""success"",
      ""deployment"": {
        ""id"": ""dep-abc123"",
        ""name"": ""deploy-1""
      }
    },
    {
      ""index"": 1,
      ""status"": ""success"",
      ""deployment"": {
        ""id"": ""dep-xyz789"",
        ""name"": ""deploy-2""
      }
    },
    {
      ""index"": 2,
      ""status"": ""error"",
      ""error"": {
        ""code"": ""CAPACITY_INSUFFICIENT"",
        ""message"": ""Insufficient capacity in ap-southeast-1""
      }
    }
  ],
  ""summary"": {
    ""total"": 3,
    ""succeeded"": 2,
    ""failed"": 1
  }
}

Batch Update:

Update multiple resources:

PATCH /batch/deployments

Request body:

{
  ""operations"": [
    {
      ""id"": ""dep-abc123"",
      ""size"": ""large""
    },
    {
      ""id"": ""dep-xyz789"",
      ""config"": {
        ""maxConnections"": 200
      }
    }
  ]
}

Batch Delete:

Delete multiple deployments:

DELETE /batch/deployments

Request body:

{
  ""ids"": [""dep-abc123"", ""dep-xyz789"", ""dep-def456""],
  ""force"": false,
  ""create_backups"": true
}

Error Handling:

fail_on_error modes:

fail_on_error: true
- Stop on first error
- Rollback successful operations
- Return partial results

fail_on_error: false (default)
- Continue despite errors
- Complete all operations
- Return all results with error details

Transaction Support:

Atomic batch operations:

POST /batch/deployments
{
  ""operations"": [...],
  ""transaction"": true
}

All-or-nothing: Either all succeed or all rollback.

Parallel Processing:

Control parallelism:

{
  ""operations"": [...],
  ""parallel"": true,
  ""max_concurrency"": 5
}

Parallel: Faster but unordered
Sequential: Slower but ordered

Rate Limits:

Batch operations count as single request:
- Batch of 10 = 1 request against rate limit
- Maximum batch size: 100 operations
- Recommended batch size: 10-50

Batch Status:

Check batch operation status:

GET /batch/operations/{batch_id}

Response:

{
  ""id"": ""batch-abc123"",
  ""status"": ""in_progress"",
  ""progress"": {
    ""total"": 100,
    ""completed"": 45,
    ""failed"": 2,
    ""pending"": 53
  },
  ""created_at"": ""2024-09-15T10:30:00Z"",
  ""estimated_completion"": ""2024-09-15T10:45:00Z""
}

Async Batch Operations:

Large batches run asynchronously:

POST /batch/deployments
{
  ""operations"": [...],  // 100 operations
  ""async"": true
}

Response:

{
  ""batch_id"": ""batch-abc123"",
  ""status"": ""accepted"",
  ""status_url"": ""/batch/operations/batch-abc123""
}

Poll for completion or use webhooks.

Batch Validation:

Validate before execution:

POST /batch/deployments/validate
{
  ""operations"": [...]
}

Returns validation errors without executing.

Partial Results:

Retrieve partial results:

GET /batch/operations/{batch_id}/results

Returns completed operations even if batch still running.

Batch Ordering:

Preserve operation order:

{
  ""operations"": [...],
  ""ordered"": true,
  ""parallel"": false
}

Operations execute in array order.

Dependency Management:

Define operation dependencies:

{
  ""operations"": [
    {
      ""id"": ""op-1"",
      ""name"": ""parent-deploy""
    },
    {
      ""id"": ""op-2"",
      ""depends_on"": [""op-1""],
      ""name"": ""child-deploy""
    }
  ]
}

Batch Limits:

Operation limits:
- Maximum operations per batch: 100
- Maximum concurrent batches: 5
- Async batch timeout: 1 hour
- Batch retention: 7 days

Best Practices:

Batch size recommendations:
- 10-50 operations: Optimal balance
- 1-10 operations: Use regular API
- 50-100 operations: Consider async
- 100+ operations: Split into multiple batches

Error recovery:
- Use fail_on_error: false
- Retry failed operations
- Log batch_id for troubleshooting
- Monitor batch status

Performance:
- Batch reduces API calls
- Faster than individual requests

doc-getting-started-017,Keyboard Shortcuts and Aliases,"NovaCLI v3.1 commands can be lengthy. This guide demonstrates keyboard shortcuts, command aliases, and productivity tips to speed up your workflow.

Built-in command aliases:

NovaCLI provides short aliases for frequently used commands:

nova d = nova deploy
nova a = nova auth
nova s = nova settings
nova l = nova logs

Combine with subcommands:

nova d create  # Same as nova deploy create
nova d ls      # Same as nova deploy list
nova l tail    # Same as nova logs tail

Create custom shell aliases for your most common operations:

Bash/Zsh:

alias ndeploy='nova deploy create --size small --env development'
alias nlist='nova deploy list --format table'
alias ninfo='nova deploy info'

Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc for persistence.

Fish:

abbr ndeploy 'nova deploy create --size small --env development'
abbr nlist 'nova deploy list --format table'

PowerShell:

Set-Alias ndeploy 'nova deploy create'
function nlist { nova deploy list --format table }

Add to your PowerShell profile.

Shell functions provide more flexibility than aliases:

Create a deployment with sensible defaults:

function quick-deploy() {
  local name=$1
  nova deploy create 
    --name $name 
    --region us-east-1 
    --size small 
    --env development 
    --engine postgresql-15
}

Usage:

quick-deploy my-app

Delete deployment by name:

function quick-delete() {
  nova deploy delete $(nova deploy list --format json | jq -r "".[] | select(.name==""$1"") | .id"") --confirm
}

Get deployment ID by name:

function did() {
  nova deploy list --format json | jq -r "".[] | select(.name==""$1"") | .id""
}

Usage:

nova deploy info $(did my-app)

Environment variables set default values:

export NOVA_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-1
export NOVA_DEFAULT_SIZE=medium

Now deployments use these defaults when flags are omitted.

Shell history search (Ctrl+R) finds previous commands quickly. Tag commands with comments for easier retrieval:

nova deploy create --name prod-app  # production deployment

Searching for ""production"" finds this command.

Tab completion (covered in shell completion guide) significantly reduces typing. Always press Tab after partial commands.

For frequently accessed deployments, store IDs in variables:

PROD_DEPLOY=$(did production-app)

doc-troubleshooting-018,Resolving Replication Lag,"Replication lag causes read replicas to serve stale data, impacting application consistency. NovaCLI v3.1 provides tools to monitor, diagnose, and reduce replication delays.

Measuring Replication Lag:

Check current lag for all replicas:

nova deploy replication-status deployment-id

This displays lag in seconds and bytes for each replica. Lag above 5 seconds may impact application behavior.

Causes of Replication Lag:

Common causes include:

- High write volume exceeding replica capacity
- Network latency between primary and replica
- Resource constraints on replica (CPU, disk I/O)
- Long-running queries blocking replication on replica

Write Volume:

Excessive write activity can overwhelm replication. Monitor write rate:

nova deploy stats deployment-id --metric writes-per-second

Reduce write volume by batching writes, using bulk operations, or upgrading replica size:

nova replica resize replica-id --size large

Network Latency:

Cross-region replicas experience higher lag due to network distance. Measure network latency:

ping -c 10 replica-hostname

For latency-sensitive applications, use same-region replicas.

Replica Resource Constraints:

Check replica resource usage:

nova deploy stats replica-id --detailed

If CPU or disk I/O is saturated, upgrade replica resources:

nova replica resize replica-id --size xlarge

Blocking Queries:

Long-running queries on replicas can block replication. Identify blocking queries:

nova deploy queries replica-id --blocking

Terminate problematic queries:

nova deploy kill-query replica-id query-id

Replication Configuration:

Tune replication parameters for better performance:

nova replica update replica-id --parallel-workers 8

More parallel workers improve replication throughput but consume more resources.

Monitoring and Alerts:

Set up alerts for excessive lag:

nova alerts create --replica replica-id --metric lag-seconds --threshold 10

This alerts when lag exceeds 10 seconds.

Failover Considerations:

doc-api-reference-022,API Testing and Mock Server,"NovaCLI provides testing tools including a mock API server for development and integration testing. This reference covers test environments, mock data, and testing best practices.

Mock Server:

Local mock server for development:

nova mock-server start --port 8080

Access at:
http://localhost:8080/v1

Mock server features:
- Returns realistic responses
- No authentication required
- Predictable data
- No rate limits
- Instant responses

Configuration:

Customize mock behavior:

nova mock-server start 
  --port 8080 
  --latency 100 
  --error-rate 0.05

Options:
- latency: Simulate network delay (ms)
- error-rate: Random error percentage (0.0-1.0)
- seed: Deterministic random data

Mock Data:

Predictable mock deployments:

GET http://localhost:8080/v1/deployments

Returns:
- dep-mock-001 through dep-mock-100
- Various regions and sizes
- Different statuses
- Consistent across restarts with same seed

Custom Mock Data:

Load custom fixtures:

nova mock-server start --fixtures ./fixtures.json

fixtures.json:

{
  ""deployments"": [
    {
      ""id"": ""dep-test-1"",
      ""name"": ""test-deployment"",
      ""status"": ""active""
    }
  ]
}

Testing Environments:

Environment URLs:

Production: https://api.novacli.io
Staging: https://staging-api.novacli.io
Sandbox: https://sandbox-api.novacli.io
Local Mock: http://localhost:8080

Sandbox environment:
- Free tier unlimited
- Test data isolated
- Safe for experiments
- Reset daily at 00:00 UTC

Test API Keys:

Generate test keys:

nova api-key create 
  --name ""test-key"" 
  --environment sandbox

Test keys:
- Prefix: nova_test_
- Only work in sandbox
- Cannot access production
- No rate limits

Integration Testing:

Python example:

import unittest
from novacli import Client

class TestDeployments(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.client = Client(
            api_key=""nova_test_abc123"",
            base_url=""http://localhost:8080""
        )
    
    def test_create_deployment(self):
        deployment = self.client.deployments.create(
            name=""test-deploy"",
            size=""small""
        )
        self.assertEqual(http://deployment.name, ""test-deploy"")

JavaScript example:

const { NovaCLI } = require('@novacli/sdk');
const assert = require('assert');

describe('Deployments', () => {
  const client = new NovaCLI({
    apiKey: 'nova_test_abc123',
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:8080'
  });

  it('should create deployment', async () => {
    const deployment = await client.deployments.create({
      name: 'test-deploy',
      size: 'small'
    });
    assert.equal(http://deployment.name, 'test-deploy');
  });
});

Mock Error Scenarios:

Simulate specific errors:

GET http://localhost:8080/v1/deployments/error-404

Returns 404 Not Found

GET http://localhost:8080/v1/deployments/error-500

Returns 500 Internal Server Error

Special IDs:
- error-400: Bad Request
- error-401: Unauthorized
- error-403: Forbidden
- error-404: Not Found
- error-429: Rate Limited
- error-500: Server Error
- slow-response: 5 second delay

Webhook Testing:

Test webhook delivery:

nova mock-server start --webhook-target http://localhost:3000/webhook

Mock server sends test webhooks:
- deployment.created events
- Every 30 seconds
- Valid HMAC signatures

Snapshot Testing:

Record/replay API interactions:

nova test record --output snapshots/

Records actual API responses.

nova mock-server start --snapshots snapshots/

Replays recorded responses.

Contract Testing:

Validate API contracts:

nova test contract --spec openapi.json

Verifies:
- Response schemas match spec
- Required fields present
- Data types correct
- Status codes valid

Load Testing:

Test against mock server:

nova test load 
  --url http://localhost:8080 
  --requests 1000 
  --concurrency 50

Safe load testing without affecting production.

Docker Support:

Run mock server in Docker:

docker run -p 8080:8080 novacli/mock-server

Docker Compose:

services:
  mock-api:
    image: novacli/mock-server
    ports:
      - ""8080:8080""
    environment:
      - LATENCY=50
      - ERROR_RATE=0.01

CLI Testing:

Test CLI commands:

nova test cli --command ""deploy list"" --mock

Uses mock server automatically.

Coverage Tracking:

Track API endpoint coverage:

doc-authentication-3.1-winner,Configuring SCRAM-SHA-256 for Read-Only Users,"NovaCLI v3.1 introduces a streamlined approach to configuring SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication for read-only database users. This guide walks through the current best practice for securing user access without requiring manual edits to configuration files.

SCRAM-SHA-256 is a challenge-response authentication mechanism that provides stronger password security compared to legacy MD5 methods. For read-only users who need to query databases without write privileges, proper authentication configuration is critical to maintaining the principle of least privilege.

To configure SCRAM-SHA-256 for a read-only user in NovaCLI v3.1, use the ALTER SYSTEM command to modify authentication settings dynamically:

First, create the read-only user with SCRAM-SHA-256 as the password method:

CREATE ROLE readonly_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'secure_password';
ALTER ROLE readonly_user SET scram_iterations = 4096;

Next, configure the authentication method system-wide:

ALTER SYSTEM SET password_encryption = 'scram-sha-256';
ALTER SYSTEM SET auth_method_readonly = 'scram-sha-256';

Reload the configuration to apply changes:

nova settings reload

Finally, grant read-only permissions to the appropriate databases:

GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE production TO readonly_user;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO readonly_user;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO readonly_user;

This approach eliminates the need to manually edit pg_hba.conf or other configuration files, reducing the risk of syntax errors and making authentication changes auditable through the system catalog. The ALTER SYSTEM method is the recommended approach for NovaCLI v3.x and provides compatibility with containerized deployments where configuration file access may be restricted.

doc-configuration-025,Compliance and Governance Configuration,"NovaCLI v3.1 provides compliance and governance features to meet regulatory requirements and organizational policies. This guide covers configuring compliance controls, policy enforcement, and audit trails.

Compliance Mode:

Enable compliance mode:

[compliance]
mode = ""strict""  # or ""standard"", ""custom""
frameworks = [""SOC2"", ""HIPAA"", ""GDPR"", ""PCI-DSS""]

Strict mode enforces all controls automatically.

Data Classification:

Classify deployment data:

[http://compliance.data_classification]
default_level = ""internal""
supported_levels = [""public"", ""internal"", ""confidential"", ""restricted""]

Set classification:

nova deploy update <deployment-id> 
  --data-classification confidential

Encryption Requirements:

Enforce encryption based on classification:

[compliance.encryption]
required_for = [""confidential"", ""restricted""]
at_rest = true
in_transit = true
key_rotation_days = 90

Access Controls:

Enforce access control policies:

[compliance.access_control]
require_mfa = true
max_session_duration = 480  # minutes
require_justification = [""deploy:delete"", ""data:export""]

Provide justification:

nova deploy delete <deployment-id> 
  --justification ""Decommissioning obsolete service""

Data Retention:

Enforce retention policies:

[compliance.retention]
audit_logs_days = 2555  # 7 years
backup_retention_days = 90
data_deletion_after_days = 365

Automatic deletion:

[compliance.deletion]
auto_delete_expired = true
require_approval = true
approvers = [""mailto:compliance-team@company.com""]

Data Residency:

Enforce geographic restrictions:

[http://compliance.data_residency]
enabled = true
allowed_regions = [""eu-west-1"", ""eu-central-1""]
prohibit_cross_border = true

Change Management:

Require approval for changes:

[compliance.change_management]
require_change_ticket = true
ticket_system = ""jira""
ticket_url_pattern = ""https://jira.company.com/browse/{ticket_id}""

Create deployment with ticket:

nova deploy create 
  --name my-deployment 
  --change-ticket CHANGE-12345

Segregation of Duties:

Enforce role separation:

[compliance.segregation]
enabled = true
separate_roles = [[""creator"", ""approver""], [""developer"", ""auditor""]]

Same user cannot have conflicting roles.

Privacy Controls:

Protect personal data:

[compliance.privacy]
pii_detection = true
pii_masking = true
pii_fields = [""email"", ""phone"", ""ssn""]

Masked in logs and exports.

Right to be Forgotten:

Support data subject requests:

nova compliance delete-user-data 
  --user-id 12345 
  --reason ""GDPR data subject request""

Compliance Reports:

Generate compliance reports:

nova compliance report 
  --framework SOC2 
  --period 2024-Q3 
  --output report.pdf

Automatic reporting:

[compliance.reporting]
auto_generate = true
frequency = ""monthly""
recipients = [""mailto:compliance@company.com""]

Policy as Code:

Define policies programmatically:

# policy.rego
package novacli.compliance

allow_deployment {
  input.size != ""xlarge""
  input.region in [""us-east-1"", ""us-west-2""]
  input.encryption_enabled == true
}

Load policy:

nova policy load compliance-policy.rego

Violation Detection:

Detect policy violations:

[compliance.monitoring]
continuous_monitoring = true
violation_alerting = true
auto_remediation = false

Review violations:

nova compliance violations --days 30

Compliance Dashboard:

View compliance status:

nova compliance dashboard

Displays:
- Compliance score
- Active violations
- Remediation progress
- Audit findings

Third-Party Attestations:

Integrate with compliance platforms:

[compliance.integrations]
vanta_enabled = true
vanta_api_key = ""${VANTA_API_KEY}""

drata_enabled = true
drata_webhook = ""${DRATA_WEBHOOK}""

Certification Evidence:

Collect evidence automatically:

[compliance.evidence]
auto_collect = true
evidence_types = [""logs"", ""configs"", ""access_reports""]
storage_location = ""s3://compliance-evidence/""

Export evidence:

nova compliance export-evidence

doc-getting-started-018,Understanding NovaCLI Pricing,"NovaCLI deployments incur charges based on instance size, storage, data transfer, and optional add-ons. Understanding the pricing model helps you optimize costs while meeting performance requirements.

Instance Pricing:

Instances are billed hourly based on size. Pricing is pro-rated to the second, so you only pay for actual usage.

Small: $0.05/hour (~$36/month)
Medium: $0.15/hour (~$108/month)
Large: $0.40/hour (~$288/month)
Extra-Large: $1.00/hour (~$720/month)

Development instances cost 30% less but have lower uptime SLAs and may be preempted during peak demand.

Storage Pricing:

Storage is billed per GB-month:

Standard SSD: $0.10/GB/month
High-performance NVMe: $0.25/GB/month

Storage scales automatically as your data grows. You're billed for allocated storage, not provisioned capacity.

Data Transfer:

Inbound data transfer: Free
Outbound to internet: $0.09/GB after 100GB free tier
Outbound to same region: Free
Outbound to different region: $0.02/GB

Backup Storage:

Automated backups (last 7 days): Included
Extended backup retention: $0.05/GB/month
Cross-region backup copies: $0.08/GB/month

Optional Add-ons:

High Availability (multi-zone): +50% of instance cost
Read replicas: Full instance cost per replica
Point-in-time recovery: $0.10/GB/month

Shows charges by deployment and resource type.

Set spending alerts:

nova billing set-alert --threshold 500 --email mailto:your@email.com

Receive notifications when monthly spending approaches limits.

Cost optimization tips:

1. Right-size instances. Start small and scale up based on metrics.
2. Use development mode for non-production workloads.
3. Delete unused deployments promptly.
4. Stop deployments during off-hours if downtime is acceptable.
5. Keep backups in the same region unless compliance requires otherwise.
6. Monitor data transfer patterns and optimize query efficiency.

Free tier:

New accounts receive $100 credit valid for 30 days. Sufficient for several weeks of small instance usage.

doc-troubleshooting-005,Resolving Backup and Restore Failures,"Backup and restore operations are critical for data protection. When these operations fail in NovaCLI v3.1, prompt diagnosis and resolution prevents data loss and minimizes downtime.

Backup Failure: Insufficient Storage:

The most common backup failure is insufficient backup storage quota. Error: ""Backup failed: Storage quota exceeded (used: 500GB/500GB)."" Delete old backups to free space:

nova backup list --deployment deployment-id
nova backup delete backup-id

Alternatively, increase your backup storage quota in the Nova dashboard under Settings > Billing > Storage.

Backup Failure: Lock Timeout:

Backups require exclusive locks on certain database objects. If your deployment has long-running queries or transactions, backup may fail with ""Lock acquisition timeout."" Terminate blocking queries:

nova deploy queries deployment-id --filter ""state=active AND duration > 3600""

Kill long-running queries before retrying backup:

nova deploy kill-query deployment-id query-id

Restore Failure: Version Mismatch:

Restoring backups across incompatible versions fails. Error: ""Cannot restore v2.0 backup to v3.1 deployment."" You must restore to a deployment running the same major version as the backup source, then upgrade.

Create a v2.0 deployment, restore the backup, then upgrade:

nova deploy create --version 2.0 --name temp-restore
nova backup restore backup-id --target temp-restore
nova deploy upgrade temp-restore --version 3.1

Restore Failure: Insufficient Resources:

Restoring large backups requires adequate deployment resources. If restore fails with ""Out of memory"" or ""Disk space exhausted,"" resize the target deployment before restoring:

nova deploy resize deployment-id --size xlarge
nova backup restore backup-id --target deployment-id

Corrupted Backup:

Rarely, backups become corrupted due to storage issues. Error: ""Backup integrity check failed."" Try an earlier backup:

nova backup list --deployment deployment-id --sort created_at:desc

If all recent backups are corrupted, contact support immediately for recovery options.

Partial Restore:

For large databases, consider partial restore to reduce time and resource requirements:

doc-getting-started-019,Getting Started FAQ,"This FAQ addresses common questions from new NovaCLI v3.1 users. Answers provide quick guidance for typical scenarios.

Q: Do I need an existing Nova account to use NovaCLI?

A: Yes. Create a free account at http://nova.io before installing NovaCLI. The CLI authenticates with your account credentials.

Q: Can I manage multiple Nova organizations with one NovaCLI installation?

A: Yes. Use profiles (nova profiles create) to switch between organizations. Each profile stores separate authentication.

Q: Are deployment names unique globally or per account?

A: Deployment names must be unique within your organization, not globally. Multiple organizations can use the same deployment name.

Q: How long does deployment creation take?

A: Typically 3-5 minutes for small to medium instances. Large instances may take 7-10 minutes. Development mode provisions slightly faster.

Q: Can I change instance size after creation?

A: Yes. Use nova deploy resize <deployment-id> --size <new-size>. Resizing causes brief downtime (30-90 seconds) in v3.1.

Q: What happens if my authentication token expires?

A: Commands will fail with ""authentication required"" errors. Run nova auth login to refresh your token. Tokens expire after 30 days of inactivity.

Q: Can I use NovaCLI without internet access?

A: No. NovaCLI communicates with Nova API servers for all operations. Internet connectivity is required.

Q: Does NovaCLI work behind a corporate proxy?

A: Yes. Configure proxy settings: nova settings set proxy.http <url> and nova settings set proxy.https <url>. Or use environment variables: HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY.

Q: How do I update NovaCLI to the latest version?

A: Method depends on installation. Package managers: apt update && apt upgrade novacli. Homebrew: brew upgrade novacli. Manual: download new binary and replace existing.

Q: Are my credentials stored securely?

A: Yes. Credentials are encrypted at rest using platform-specific secure storage: Keychain (macOS), Credential Manager (Windows), encrypted file (Linux).

Q: Can I script NovaCLI commands?

A: Yes. NovaCLI is designed for automation. Use --format json for machine-readable output and environment variables for authentication.

Q: What's the difference between stopping and deleting a deployment?

A: Stopping pauses the deployment, stopping compute charges but retaining data. Deleting permanently removes everything and cannot be undone.

Q: How do I get help for a specific command?

A: Append --help to any command: nova deploy create --help. Displays all flags, examples, and detailed descriptions.

Q: Does NovaCLI support Windows PowerShell?

doc-troubleshooting-025,Resolving Billing and Quota Errors,"Billing issues and quota limits interrupt service and prevent resource provisioning. Understanding billing errors and quota management restores full functionality in NovaCLI v3.1.

Common Billing Errors:

- ""Payment method declined""
- ""Account suspended: payment overdue""
- ""Insufficient credits for operation""
- ""Billing information incomplete""

Payment Failures:

When payment fails, update payment method:

nova account update-payment --card-number XXXX

Or update via dashboard at https://dashboard.nova.io/billing

Account Suspension:

Overdue payments result in account suspension:

- 7 days overdue: warning emails sent
- 14 days overdue: new deployments blocked
- 30 days overdue: existing deployments suspended (read-only)
- 60 days overdue: deployments deleted

Reactivate suspended account:

1. Update payment method
2. Pay outstanding balance
3. Contact support to restore service

Quota Limits:

Each plan has resource quotas:

- Number of deployments
- Total storage
- Number of backups
- API request rate

Check current quota usage:

nova account quota

This shows limits and current usage for all resources.

Exceeding Quotas:

""Quota exceeded"" errors prevent new resource creation. Options:

- Delete unused resources to free quota
- Upgrade plan for higher limits
- Request temporary quota increase from support

Upgrading Plans:

Upgrade to higher tier for increased quotas:

nova account upgrade --plan pro

Upgrades take effect immediately. No service interruption.

Usage Monitoring:

Monitor usage to avoid unexpected charges:

nova account usage --month 2024-09

This shows detailed usage breakdown by resource type.

Billing Alerts:

Set alerts for usage thresholds:

nova account set-alert --type usage --threshold 80

Alerts at 80% of quota or budget limits enable proactive management.

Invoice Issues:

Access invoices for accounting:

nova account invoices --year 2024

Download specific invoices:

nova account invoice-download invoice-id > invoice.pdf

Cost Optimization:

Reduce costs by:

- Deleting unused deployments
- Reducing backup retention periods
- Downsizing over-provisioned deployments
- Using reserved instances for predictable workloads

doc-api-reference-024,API Performance Optimization Guide,"Optimize API usage for maximum performance and efficiency. This reference covers caching strategies, request optimization, and performance best practices for the NovaCLI API.

Response Caching:

Cache-Control headers:

GET /deployments/dep-abc123

Response includes:

Cache-Control: max-age=60, private
ETag: ""abc123def456""
Last-Modified: Wed, 15 Sep 2024 10:30:00 GMT

Conditional Requests:

Use ETags for conditional requests:

GET /deployments/dep-abc123
If-None-Match: ""abc123def456""

Response:
- 304 Not Modified: Use cached version
- 200 OK: Resource changed, new data

Last-Modified:

GET /deployments/dep-abc123
If-Modified-Since: Wed, 15 Sep 2024 10:30:00 GMT

Response:
- 304 Not Modified: Not changed
- 200 OK: Resource updated

Client-Side Caching:

Cache implementation:

const cache = new Map();
const CACHE_TTL = 60000; // 1 minute

async function getCached(url) {
  const cached = cache.get(url);
  if (cached && http://Date.now() - cached.timestamp < CACHE_TTL) {
    return http://cached.data;
  }
  
  const data = await fetch(url);
  cache.set(url, {
    data,
    timestamp: http://Date.now()
  });
  return data;
}

Request Optimization:

Field selection:

GET /deployments?fields=id,name,status

Returns only requested fields:
- Smaller payloads
- Faster responses
- Lower bandwidth
- Better performance

GraphQL for precise queries:

query {
  deployment(id: ""dep-abc123"") {
    id
    name
    status
  }
}

Fetch exactly what you need.

Batch Requests:

Batch multiple operations:

POST /batch/operations
{
  ""operations"": [
    {""method"": ""GET"", ""path"": ""/deployments/dep-1""},
    {""method"": ""GET"", ""path"": ""/deployments/dep-2""},
    {""method"": ""GET"", ""path"": ""/deployments/dep-3""}
  ]
}

Benefits:
- Single network round trip
- Lower latency
- Fewer rate limit hits
- Reduced overhead

Connection Reuse:

HTTP Keep-Alive:

Connection: keep-alive

Reuse TCP connections:
- Eliminate handshake overhead
- Reduce latency
- Better throughput

HTTP/2 support:
- Multiplexed streams
- Header compression
- Server push
- Lower latency

Compression:

Request compression:

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br

Response compressed:

Content-Encoding: gzip

Reduction:
- 70-90% smaller payloads
- Faster transfers
- Lower bandwidth costs

Pagination Strategy:

Optimal page size:

// Too small - many requests
GET /deployments?limit=10  // Bad

// Optimal balance
GET /deployments?limit=50  // Good

// Too large - slow response
GET /deployments?limit=500  // Bad

Recommended:
- 50-100 items per page
- Use cursor pagination
- Fetch on demand
- Implement virtual scrolling

Parallel Requests:

Fetch in parallel:

const [deployments, backups, metrics] = await Promise.all([
  client.deployments.list(),
  client.backups.list('dep-abc123'),
  client.metrics.get('dep-abc123')
]);

Benefits:
- Reduced total time
- Better resource utilization
- Improved user experience

Caution: Respect rate limits

Request Debouncing:

Debounce rapid requests:

let debounceTimer;

function debouncedSearch(query) {
  clearTimeout(debounceTimer);
  debounceTimer = setTimeout(() => {
    http://api.search(query);
  }, 300);
}

Prevents excessive API calls during typing.

Webhooks vs Polling:

Polling (inefficient):

setInterval(() => {
  client.deployments.get('dep-abc123');
}, 5000);

Problems:
- Wastes API calls
- Higher latency
- Rate limit issues

Webhooks (efficient):

client.webhooks.create({
  url: 'https://myapp.com/webhook',
  events: ['deployment.updated']
});

Benefits:
- Real-time updates
- No polling overhead
- Lower rate limit usage

CDN and Edge Caching:

Cache at edge:

Use regional endpoints:
- http://us-east-1.api.novacli.io
- http://eu-west-1.api.novacli.io
- http://ap-southeast-1.api.novacli.io

Benefits:
- Lower latency
- Geographic proximity
- Better performance

Connection Pooling:

Maintain connection pool:

const client = new NovaCLI({
  apiKey: 'nova_sk_abc123',
  pool: {
    maxConnections: 10,
    maxIdleTime: 30000
  }
});

Reuses connections efficiently.

Monitoring Performance:

Track API performance:

const start = http://Date.now();
const result = await http://api.call();
const duration = http://Date.now() - start;

http://logger.info(API call took ${duration}ms);

Metrics to track:
- Response time
- Error rate
- Cache hit ratio
- Rate limit usage

Performance Headers:

Response timing headers:

X-Response-Time: 45ms
X-Cache-Status: HIT

doc-api-reference-029,Webhooks and Event Notifications,"NovaCLI v3.1 supports webhooks for real-time notifications about deployment events, allowing you to build reactive integrations and automation workflows without polling.

Supported Events:

The webhook system can notify you about:

- deployment.created: New deployment provisioned
- deployment.updated: Deployment configuration changed
- deployment.deleted: Deployment removed
- deployment.status_changed: Status transition (pending → running, running → stopped, etc.)
- backup.completed: Automated or manual backup finished
- backup.failed: Backup operation encountered an error
- alert.triggered: Monitoring alert activated
- maintenance.scheduled: Upcoming maintenance window announced

Webhook Configuration:

Create a webhook endpoint through the API:

POST /api/v3/webhooks
{""url"": ""https://your-app.com/webhooks/nova"", ""events"": [""deployment.status_changed"", ""alert.triggered""], ""secret"": ""your-signing-secret""}

The secret is used to verify webhook authenticity. Store it securely and use it to validate incoming requests.

Webhook Payload:

All webhook events use a consistent payload structure:

{""event"": ""deployment.status_changed"", ""timestamp"": ""2024-09-18T14:23:45Z"", ""data"": {""deployment_id"": ""dep-abc123"", ""old_status"": ""pending"", ""new_status"": ""running""}, ""webhook_id"": ""wh-xyz789""}

Signature Verification:

Each webhook request includes an X-Nova-Signature header containing an HMAC SHA-256 signature of the request body:

expected_signature = HMAC-SHA256(request_body, webhook_secret)
if request.headers['X-Nova-Signature'] != expected_signature:
    return 401

Always verify signatures to prevent spoofed requests.

Retry Behavior:

If your endpoint returns a non-2xx status or times out after 10 seconds, Nova retries with exponential backoff:

- Retry 1: after 30 seconds
- Retry 2: after 5 minutes
- Retry 3: after 30 minutes
- Retry 4: after 2 hours

After 4 failed attempts, the webhook is marked as failing. Consecutive failures over 7 days will disable the webhook.

Testing Webhooks:

Test your webhook endpoint:

doc-configuration-017,Advanced Security Hardening,"NovaCLI v3.1 provides security hardening options beyond basic configuration. This guide covers advanced security features including encryption, access controls, and threat mitigation.

Encryption at Rest:

Enable transparent data encryption:

[security.encryption]
at_rest_enabled = true
algorithm = ""AES-256-GCM""
key_rotation_days = 90
key_source = ""kms""  # or ""vault"", ""local""

Key rotation limits exposure from compromised keys.

Encryption in Transit:

Enforce TLS for all connections:

[security.tls]
min_version = ""1.3""
cipher_suites = [""TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"", ""TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256""]
verify_client_cert = true

Strong cipher suites prevent cryptographic attacks.

Role-Based Access Control:

Define granular permissions:

[security.rbac]
enabled = true
default_role = ""viewer""

[security.rbac.roles.admin]
permissions = [""*""]

[security.rbac.roles.operator]
permissions = [""deploy:create"", ""deploy:update"", ""deploy:delete""]

[security.rbac.roles.viewer]
permissions = [""deploy:list"", ""deploy:read""]

Principle of least privilege limits blast radius.

Multi-Factor Authentication:

Require MFA for sensitive operations:

[security.mfa]
enabled = true
provider = ""totp""  # or ""duo"", ""okta""
require_for_operations = [""deploy:delete"", ""user:create""]

Prevents unauthorized access from stolen credentials.

IP Restriction Policies:

Restrict administrative access:

[security.ip_restriction]
admin_allowlist = [""10.0.0.0/8"", ""203.0.113.42/32""]
enforce_for_api = true
enforce_for_cli = true

Geographic restrictions:

[security.geo_restriction]
allowed_countries = [""US"", ""CA""]
block_tor_exit_nodes = true
block_vpn_providers = false

Rate Limiting:

Prevent brute force attacks:

[security.rate_limiting]
login_attempts_per_hour = 10
api_requests_per_minute = 100
penalty_duration_minutes = 30

Session Management:

Secure session configuration:

[security.sessions]
max_duration_hours = 8
idle_timeout_minutes = 30
require_reauth_for_sensitive = true
single_session_per_user = false

Sessions expire after inactivity period.

Command Authorization:

Require approval for dangerous operations:

[security.authorization]
require_approval = [""deploy:delete"", ""config:update""]
approvers_required = 2
approver_roles = [""admin"", ""senior-operator""]

Two-person rule prevents accidental damage.

Vulnerability Scanning:

Automatic security scanning:

[security.scanning]
container_scanning = true
dependency_scanning = true
scan_frequency = ""daily""
fail_on_critical = true

Integration with security tools:

[security.integrations]
trivy_enabled = true
snyk_api_key = ""${SNYK_API_KEY}""

Security Headers:

Configure HTTP security headers:

[security.headers]
strict_transport_security = ""max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains""
content_security_policy = ""default-src 'self'""
x_frame_options = ""DENY""
x_content_type_options = ""nosniff""

Prevents common web attacks.

Secret Scanning:

Detect accidentally committed secrets:

[security.secret_scanning]
enabled = true
patterns = [""api_key"", ""password"", ""private_key""]
alert_on_detection = true

Integration with GitGuardian or similar tools.

Security Policies:

Enforce organizational policies:

[security.policies]
password_min_length = 16
password_require_special = true
password_expiry_days = 90
account_lockout_attempts = 5

Compliance Certifications:

Meet certification requirements:

[security.compliance]
soc2_mode = true
hipaa_mode = false

doc-api-reference-030,API Versioning and Deprecation Policy,"The Nova REST API uses explicit versioning to ensure backward compatibility while enabling innovation. Understanding the versioning strategy helps you plan upgrades and avoid breaking changes.

Version Format:

API versions are specified in the URL path:

GET https://api.nova.io/api/v3/deployments

The current version is v3, released alongside NovaCLI v3.0 in June 2024. Each major CLI release typically introduces a new API version.

Supported Versions:

Nova maintains three API versions simultaneously:

- v3 (current): Full support, all new features
- v2 (maintenance): Security fixes only, no new features
- v1 (deprecated): Security fixes for critical vulnerabilities only

Version Lifecycle:

Each API version follows a predictable lifecycle:

1. Active (18 months): Full support, new features, bug fixes
2. Maintenance (12 months): Security fixes only, no new endpoints or features
3. Deprecated (6 months): Critical security fixes only, sunset warnings in API responses
4. Sunset: Version removed, requests return 410 Gone

Deprecation Warnings:

When using deprecated features or versions, API responses include warning headers:

X-Nova-Deprecation: This endpoint will be removed on 2025-06-10. Migrate to /api/v3/deployments.

Monitor these warnings in your logs to identify migration tasks.

Breaking vs Non-Breaking Changes:

Within a major version, Nova only makes non-breaking changes:

- Adding new endpoints (non-breaking)
- Adding optional request parameters (non-breaking)
- Adding response fields (non-breaking)
- Removing or renaming endpoints (breaking, requires new major version)
- Changing required parameters (breaking)
- Changing response field types (breaking)

Migration Support:

When new API versions are released, Nova provides:

- Migration guides documenting all breaking changes
- Parallel support for old and new versions during the migration window
- CLI commands to test against new versions: nova api-version set v4

Best Practices:

doc-troubleshooting-015,Resolving Data Corruption Issues,"Data corruption is rare but serious, requiring immediate attention to prevent data loss. NovaCLI v3.1 provides detection and recovery tools for corruption scenarios.

Detecting Corruption:

Corruption symptoms include:

- Unexpected query errors: ""invalid page header""
- Deployment crash and restart loops
- Inconsistent query results
- Backup failures with integrity errors

Run integrity checks:

nova deploy check-integrity deployment-id

This scans all data files for corruption and reports affected tables.

Common Causes:

Data corruption typically results from:

- Hardware failures (disk errors, memory errors)
- Improper shutdowns or crashes during writes
- Storage system issues
- Software bugs

Immediate Actions:

When corruption is detected:

1. Stop writes to prevent further damage
2. Create an immediate backup (if possible)
3. Document error messages and affected tables
4. Contact support with diagnostic information

Partial Recovery:

For isolated corruption, recover affected tables from backups:

nova backup restore backup-id --target deployment-id --tables affected_table

This restores only the corrupted table, preserving other data.

Full Recovery:

If corruption is widespread, restore from the most recent clean backup:

nova backup list deployment-id
nova backup restore backup-id --target deployment-id

Verify backup integrity before restoring:

nova backup verify backup-id

Rebuilding Indexes:

Index corruption is more common than data corruption. Rebuild affected indexes:

nova deploy reindex deployment-id --table affected_table

For all indexes:

nova deploy reindex deployment-id --all

Reindexing can take significant time on large tables but runs online without blocking reads.

Preventing Corruption:

Minimize corruption risk:

- Enable automatic backups with appropriate frequency
- Use redundant storage tiers (RAID, replicated storage)
- Monitor hardware health metrics
- Avoid force-killing deployment processes
- Keep NovaCLI and deployment software updated

Data Validation:

Implement application-level checksums for critical data. Periodically validate checksums to detect corruption early:

doc-changelog-007,Security Advisory: CVE-2024-12345 Patched in v3.1.2,"A security vulnerability has been identified and patched in NovaCLI v3.1.2. All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade immediately.

Vulnerability Details:

CVE-2024-12345: Credential Exposure in Log Files

Severity: High (CVSS 7.5)

Affected Versions:
- NovaCLI v3.0.0 through v3.1.1
- NovaCLI v2.0.0 through v2.6.0

Unaffected Versions:
- NovaCLI v3.1.2 and later
- NovaCLI v1.x (end of life)

Description:

Under specific conditions, authentication tokens could be inadvertently written to debug log files when verbose logging is enabled. If an attacker gains access to these log files, they could extract valid API tokens and gain unauthorized access to deployments.

Exploit Conditions:

- Verbose logging must be enabled (--verbose flag or DEBUG log level)
- Log files must be accessible to attacker
- Affects CLI operations involving authentication refresh

Mitigation:

Immediate Actions:

1. Upgrade to patched version:
   - v3.1.x users: upgrade to v3.1.2
   - v2.x users: upgrade to v2.6.1

2. Rotate API tokens:
   nova auth list-tokens
   nova auth revoke-token old-token-id
   nova auth create-token --name ""Replacement Token""

3. Review log files for exposed credentials:
   grep -r ""Bearer "" ~/.nova/logs/

4. Audit access logs for suspicious activity:
   nova account audit-log --since 30d

Patch Details:

The v3.1.2 patch implements:
- Token redaction in all log outputs
- Enhanced credential scrubbing in error messages
- Secure log file permissions enforcement
- Additional security headers in API requests

Workaround for Unpatched Systems:

If immediate upgrade is not possible:
- Disable verbose logging
- Restrict log file permissions: chmod 600 ~/.nova/logs/*
- Monitor access to log directories
- Rotate tokens frequently

# =============================================================================
# Runtime Dependencies - Required for Demo
# =============================================================================
# These packages are needed to run the interactive demo (demo.py)

# Database connectivity
psycopg[binary]>=3.1.0        # PostgreSQL adapter with binary wheels

# Environment management
python-dotenv>=1.0.0          # Load .env configuration

# Terminal UI
rich>=13.0.0                  # Beautiful terminal output with tables and panels

# Embedding generation (required for interactive query input)
sentence-transformers>=2.2.0  # Generate embeddings for user queries
torch>=2.0.0                  # Required by sentence-transformers

# =============================================================================
# Note: The demo generates embeddings on-the-fly for user queries
# =============================================================================
# The dataset (150 documents) has pre-computed embeddings stored in the database.
# However, the demo needs to generate embeddings for YOUR queries in real-time,
# which requires the sentence-transformers library.
